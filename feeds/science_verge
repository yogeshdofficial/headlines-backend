Around 1 in 10 Americans lives in a place where the built environment makes it feel at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it would without that urban sprawl according to one <a href=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/urban-heat-islands-2024\">study</a> of 65 cities from last year. And after years of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02618-1\">redlining</a> that bolstered segregation and disinvestment in certain neighborhoods in the US, neighborhoods with more residents of color are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities\">often hotter than others</a>.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The dashboard includes fact sheets by county to show what factors might raise temperatures in certain areas.
