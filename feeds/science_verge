Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/12/24340818/robot-vacuum-innovations-roborock-dreame-ecovacs-ces2025\">full-fledged home robots</a> that can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you.</p>\n\n<p>Along with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading

Matter</em></p>\n\n<p>Roborock’s <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra\">S8 MaxV Ultra</a> ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed.</p>\n\n<p>The S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22960447/roborock-s7-maxv-ultra-review-robot-vacuum-mop-hybrid\">S7 MaxV Ultra</a> and has been steadily improving it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25406962/247088_Roborock_vs_DreameBot_JTuohy_0010.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 MaxV Ultra brings back the RGB camera last seen on the S7 MaxV Ultra, which makes it much better at navigating obstacles.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>That&#8217;s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest.</p>\n\n<p>For $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-with-refill-drainage-system\">Refill &amp; Drainage System</a> model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">SwitchBot S10</a> with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25405367/247088_Roborock_vs_DreameBot_JTuohy_0008.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 MaxV Ultra uses two small appendages to better get into corners and clean along edges.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up.</p>\n\n<p>Roborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. </p>\n\n<p>It also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. </p>\n\n<p>Its sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners.</p>\n\n<p>Roborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” </p>\n\n<p>Roborock also sells the <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-max-ultra\">S8 Max Ultra</a> (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV.</p>\n\n<p>There are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"VGFl7c\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24141479/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-vs-dreame-x30-ultra-robot-vacuum-mop\">Read my Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum\">Best budget robot vacuum</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Tapo RV30 Max Plus</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/8A0A2480.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A black robot vacuum on a hardwood floor\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Cheap, even with the auto-empty dock </li><li>A dual mop and dustbin means no swapping</li><li>Room-specific cleaning</li><li>Carpet boost</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Short battery life</li><li>Slow to recharge</li><li>Docking can be spotty</li><li>Basic obstacle detection</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tapo-Self-Emptying-Max-RV30-Plus/dp/B0DGRJKDKC\"> <strike>$299.99</strike> $209.99 at <strong>Amazon (with code 40TAPOVAC)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.store.tp-link.com/products/tapo-rv30-max-plus-5300pa-suction-robot-vacuum-mop-with-auto-empty-dock\"> <strike>$299.99</strike> $209.99 at <strong>TP-Link (code automatically applied at checkout)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><em><strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>300ml<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Auto-refill mop option: </strong>No<strong> / Mop lift: </strong>No <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mop washing</strong>: No <strong>/  Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ <strong>AI-powered obstacle detection: </strong>No / <strong>Suction power:</strong> 5,300Pa<strong> / <em><em><strong>Remote check-in:</strong> </em></em></strong><em><em>No</em></em><em><em> </em></em></em>/</em> <em><em><strong>Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual / <strong>Brush style: </strong>Single rubber bristle hybrid<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you&#8217;re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8A0A2475.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Tapo RV30 Max Plus includes a compact auto-empty charging dock.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge.

Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks.</p>\n\n<p>The Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25350586/8A0A1093.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Its charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Its charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>In fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25350587/8A0A1090.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Narwal can use disposal dustbins that compress dirt, so you don’t have to empty it as often.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Narwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test.</p>\n\n<p>The app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-mop-hybrid\">Best robot vacuum / mop hybrid</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Dreame X40 Ultra</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25509055/IMG_3249.JPG?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Self-removing mop pads </li><li>Mop extension reaches under edges</li><li>Self-cleaning washboard</li><li>Dirt detection tech</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Middling AI obstacle detection </li><li>Single rubber roller brush</li><li>App can be flaky</li><li></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0CXDXKSXP\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $899.99 at <strong>Amazon (with Prime)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/dreametech-x40-ultra-robot-vacuum\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $899.99 at <strong>Dreame (with code EBX40U)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>300ml<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Auto-refill mop option: </strong>Yes<strong> / Mop-lift: </strong>Yes, 20mm <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mop washing</strong>: Hot water, hot air drying <strong>/  Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ <strong>AI-powered obstacle detection: </strong>Yes / <strong>Suction power:</strong> 12,000Pa <strong>/ Remote check-in:</strong> Yes<strong> / Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual / <strong>Brush style: </strong>Single, rubber<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts </em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive.</p>\n\n<p>The X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25354791/trim.C53A9FD9_159B_4AED_918B_FA75A3CBEC00.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.5850878170139,100,92.829824365972\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Dreame X30 Ultra shows its splits.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Its signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignleft\"><blockquote><p>If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>Roborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features.</p>\n\n<p>The X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer.</p>\n\n<p>The X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cxWX29\">Best midrange robot vacuum / mop </h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25349902/8A0A1063.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Good AI-powered obstacle detection</li><li>Effective mopping</li><li>Excellent value</li><li>Nice dock</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Single rubber / bristle brush</li><li>Lower suction power </li><li>No heated mop washing</li><li>Some navigation issues</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $549.99 at <strong>Amazon </strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://howl.link/5hncsg8w05o5l\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Eufy (with code WS24T2351)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eufy-x10-pro-omni-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-self-washing-and-self-drying-auto-empty-station-black/6576392.p\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>Unknown<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Auto-refill mop option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/<strong> Mop lift: </strong>Yes, 12mm <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mop washing</strong>: Yes, hot air drying <strong>/  Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ <strong>AI-powered obstacle detection: </strong>Yes / <strong>Suction power: </strong>8,000Pa / <strong>Remote check-in</strong>: No / <strong>Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Brush style: </strong>Single rubber / bristle hybrid<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home </em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the <a href=\"https://howl.me/clYvySdBoeH\">Eufy X8 Pro</a> self-empty robot vacuum.

Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.)</p>\n\n<p>An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25354855/8A0A1070__1_.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy uses a single rubber / bristle roller brush that isn’t as good as top-of-the-line Roombas and Roborocks.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables.

Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. </p>\n\n<p><span>The newest model, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Combo-Vacuum-AutoWash/dp/B0D9ZRH61T\" target=\"_blank\">Combo 10 Max</a>, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line</span>, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). </p>\n\n<p>While its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23489768/irobot-roomba-combo-j7-plus-robot-vacuum-mop-review\">retractable mopping system</a> is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8A0A2623.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.72910606942,100,78.54178786116\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Combo has a redesigned dock that’s very large — to accommodate two water tanks and a dust bag — but it doubles as a table.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The <a href=\"https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba-combo-j9plus-auto-fill-robot-vacuum-and-mop/C975020.html\">j9 Combo Plus</a> has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. </p>\n\n<p>iRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/8A0A2036.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The mopping pad is barely there.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>While its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use <a href=\"https://www.automate.org/vision/blogs/what-is-visual-slam-technology-and-what-is-it-used-for\">vSLAM</a>, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted.</p>\n\n<p>I really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Self-Emptying-Robot-Vacuum/dp/B0C415NHBM\">Roomba j9 Plus</a>.

Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor to full-fledged home robots that can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run. \nI’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you.\nAlong with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs. \nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWith top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $999.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Amazon\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Roborock\n\nBest budget option: Tapo RV30 Max Plus\nTap’s RV30 Max Plus is a robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $209.99 at Amazon (with code 40TAPOVAC)\n $299.99 $209.99 at TP-Link (code automatically applied at checkout)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest robot vacuum\nBest budget robot vacuum\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop \nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nOther robot vacuums to consider\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\n\nBest robot vacuum\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent vacuuming performance\nGood sonic mopping\nExtendable side brush gets into corners better\nVery good app\n\nDock is still quite ugly\nMopping tray is hard to clean\nExpensive\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $999.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Amazon\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Roborock\n\nDustbin capacity: 270ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water and heated air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 10,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via Matter\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the S7 MaxV Ultra and has been steadily improving it.\nThat’s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest.\nFor $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the Refill & Drainage System model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the SwitchBot S10 with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up.\nRoborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. \nIt also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. \nIts sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners.\nRoborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” \nRoborock also sells the S8 Max Ultra (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV.\nThere are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good.\nRead my Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra review.\nBest budget robot vacuum\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nCheap, even with the auto-empty dock \nA dual mop and dustbin means no swapping\nRoom-specific cleaning\nCarpet boost\n\nShort battery life\nSlow to recharge\nDocking can be spotty\nBasic obstacle detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $209.99 at Amazon (with code 40TAPOVAC)\n $299.99 $209.99 at TP-Link (code automatically applied at checkout)\n\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: No / Mop lift: No / Mop washing: No /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: No / Suction power: 5,300Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nFor around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.\nThanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. \nIts 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris.\nMopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean.\nAnother unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations.\n\n5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price\n\n\nThe Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.\nIt’s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nNarwal Freo X Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nThe best mopping robot\nAlso good at vacuuming\nVery quiet\nBig water tanks mean less refilling\n\nMiddling laser-based obstacle avoidance\nWonky app\nHuge charging dock\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 $429.99 at Amazon \n $1399.99 $429.99 at Narwal\n\nDustbin capacity: 1L / Self-empty dock option: No / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,200Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks.\nThe Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors.\nIts charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks.\n\nIts charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe\n\n\nIn fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets.\nNarwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test.\nThe app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job.\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $899.99 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $1499.99 $899.99 at Dreame (with code EBX40U)\n\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop-lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts \nThe Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive.\nThe X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you.\nIts signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius.\nWhile it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair.\n\nIf you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you\n\n\nRoborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features.\nThe X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer.\nThe X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature.\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop \nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $549.99 at Amazon \n $799.99 $699.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nDustbin capacity: Unknown / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber / bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home \nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the Eufy X8 Pro self-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection.\nWith 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\n\n The X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them\n\n\nThe Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.)\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nWhile its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn’t effective.\nThe Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out.\nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nRoomba Combo 10 Max\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent vacuuming\nSuperior AI obstacle detection\nSmart scrub feature works well\nAttractive dock that doubles as a table\n\nSmall mop pad\nLimited cleaning customization\nMapping can take a long time\nNavigation can be buggy\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 $599.99 at Amazon\n $1399.99 $599.99 at Best Buy\n $1399.99 $1199.99 at iRobot\n\nDustbin capacity: 250 ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, up and over / Mop washing: Yes / Mapping: Yes, vSLAM / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: N/A / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol.\nWhile Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. \nThe newest model, the Combo 10 Max, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). \nWhile its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its retractable mopping system is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. \nThe Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The j9 Combo Plus has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. \n\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out\n\n\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. \niRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition.\nWhile its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use vSLAM, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted.\nI really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. \nOverall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the Roomba j9 Plus. It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping.\nOther robot vacuums to consider\nThe 360 Vis Nav ($999.99), Dyson’s first robovac in the US in almost a decade, is a powerful beast and the best robot vacuum for carpets I’ve tested. But its navigation needs a lot of work. If you have a simple floor plan with a lot of carpets, it is worth considering, but the short battery life and lack of an auto-empty dock are major cons. Read more in this hands-on.\nThe Roomba j7 ($599.99) is a previous top pick that has great AI-powered obstacle detection, excellent navigation skills, and superior cleaning power. It can be a bit rough with furniture, but it is aggressive at getting your floors clean and is a great vacuum-only Roomba.\nThe Dreame X30 Ultra ($629.99 $1,399.99) is the older version of my top pick for a vacuum / mop hybrid and is a great buy if you can get it on sale. It does most everything the X40 Ultra does, just with lower suction power (8,3000Pa) and no flexi-arm.\nThe Roborock Q8 Max Plus ($419.99 $819.99) is the bigger brother to the Q5 Pro (my pick for pet hair in my budget robot vacuum guide), adding better obstacle detection (still no camera) and better mopping. However, it has a smaller bin to make way for a much bigger water reservoir for mopping (350ml). If you like the idea of the Q5 Pro but want better mopping, this is a good option.\nThe Roborock S8 Plus ($519.99 $999.99) is a great vacuum that can mop well, has good obstacle detection, and has a sleeker, smaller charging / auto-empty dock with no water tank. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do a good job, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors.\nThe Roborock S8 Pro Ultra (which is currently out of stock but normally retails for $1,599.99) is similar to the S8 MaxV but ditches the camera, so it’s less effective at dodging obstacles than the S8 MaxV. Get this if you don’t want a camera on your robot and don’t mind not having Matter support or a built-in voice assistant.\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 ($369.99 $699.99) was my previous runner-up pick for a midrange option that self-empties its bin, vacuums, and mops. It mops very well, but you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin.\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed — a new option for Roborock — and feature an AdaptLift chassis to climb high room transitions. The 10R features 19,000Pa suction power, StarSight 2.0 navigation, and oscillating mops. The Saros 10 has 22,000Pa of suction power, lidar navigation, and the vibrating flat mopping pad of the S8 MaxV.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($2,599), which is the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. The arm itself isn’t particularly reliable, but the Z70 still functions as an excellent robot vacuum with 22,000Pa suction power, support for Roborock’s StarSight navigation system, and an AdaptLift chassis. Read our review.\nIn March, iRobot announced a new Roomba lineup that starts at $299 and goes up to $999. All of the robovacs come with lidar navigation and mapping, 7,000Pa suction power, and four suction levels. The pricier 405 and 505 models are the first Roombas to feature dual spinning mopping pads, while the 505 also offers heated mop drying, which is something even the higher-end Combo 10 Max lacks.\niRobot also recently announced the Roomba Max 705 ($749.99 $2,599), which comes with an auto-empty dock. The Matter-compatible robovac brings back iRobot’s dual rubber roller brushes, which, based on our previous testing, do an excellent job of picking up pet hair; the 705 also features AI-powered obstacle detection, lidar navigation, and 13,000Pa of suction — the most of any Roomba to date.\nThe new Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum / mop hybrid. The $999.99 vac comes with a deep cleaner integrated into the charging dock, which you can use to spray clean water on stains before sucking everything into a separate wastewater tank. It’s also powerful, boasting up to 20,000Pa of suction power, and offers AI-powered obstacle detection and Matter support.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,299.99 $1,699.99 with code EBX50U) adds a “motorized swing arm” that acts like a leg, allowing the robovac to climb a transition up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra, only with higher suction power.\nThe Ecovacs Deebot X8 Pro Omni ($1,399.99) is the first Deebot with a roller mop. It features an extendable mop that can clean itself, boasts 18,000Pa of suction power, and comes with a redesigned auto-empty fill dock.\nThe Switchbot K10 Plus Pro Combo ($379.99 399.99) is an upgrade to the compact K10 Plus, a previous pick for the best robot vacuum for small spaces. It has better obstacle detection and a bump up to 3,000Pa of suction power. Plus, its auto-empty dock incorporates a manual stick vacuum.\nThe Switchbot S20 robot vacuum / mop hybrid ($799.99), which looks like the Switchbot S20 Pro announced at CES, is now available to preorder ahead of its release date in early August. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, which is more than twice that of our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum (the last-gen S10). \nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum / mop ($649.99 $999.99) can lift itself over rugs by up to 20mm. Uniquely, its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags.\nRoborock’s Qrevo Curv ($1,299.99 $1,599.99) can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The svelte-looking bot gets its name from a curved FlexiArm Arc side brush, which helps prevent hair from tangling as much.\nNarwal’s Freo Z Ultra ($1,299.99 $1,499.99) is an upgrade to my current pick for a best mopping bot. It features dual cameras and dual AI chips for seeing and identifying objects, which should help with obstacle detection and vacuuming methods.\nThe Eufy S1 Pro ($1,299.99 $1,499.99) has a long roller mop that self-cleans as it mops and features a square-ish design that allows it to get into corners more easily. A single rubber roller brush, 8,000Pa of suction, and 3D-powered obstacle detection tackle the vacuuming.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection and uses cameras to navigate. It’s also the first robovac mop I’ve seen that can suck up wet spills as well as dry. Here’s some video of it in action.\nPhotos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, July 1st: Adjusted pricing / availability, added a note regarding Prime Day, and flagged that the Switchbot S20 is now available for preorder.

And of the four watches Samsung has in its current lineup, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Although Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch 7 last July, there wasn’t a refresh for the Classic. That means you ought to be seeing some good deals for the Classic soon, if not already. It’s not often that I recommend a last-gen device, but such is my deep love for the physical rotating bezel. For what it’s worth, <em>Android Central </em><a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6\">reports that</a> that Samsung’s leaked Wear OS 6 plans include late 2025 updates for the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, as well as the Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE.</p>\n\n<p>If you want the latest and greatest, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch 7</a> offers an upgraded 3nm Exynos W1000 chip and a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor. It’s a marginal improvement over the 2023 models, but I don’t feel like Samsung introduced anything last year that requires having them. Mostly, I recommend the 7 if you prefer a smaller size, don’t care about the rotating bezel, and want something a smidge more futureproof.</p>\n\n<p>The Classic’s rotating bezel is 15 percent thinner than the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The updated design is sleeker than its predecessor, and the larger display is easier on the eyes and is only slightly bigger at 43mm and 47mm. I have small wrists, but the 47mm was still quite comfortable for everyday wear. It launched with Wear OS 4, but currently runs on Wear OS 5, which introduced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24156161/wear-os-5-google-io-smartwatch\">better battery life</a>, and more useful watch face complications.  While I prefer the Classic, the base Watch 6 model may be the better option if you want a smaller, lighter, sleeker, and cheaper smartwatch.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24816190/236731_Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_6_AKrales_0180.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic on top of a tennis racket\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic on top of a tennis racket\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 40mm Galaxy Watch 6 and the 47mm Watch 6 Classic are iterative updates, but deliver a familiar yet elevated experience.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>For more outdoorsy folks, the $649.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> might be the more sensible choice. Of all Samsung’s watches, it has the best battery life, lasting around three days in our testing. (Though, we never got the full 100-hour estimated battery life.) It’s got dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, increased durability, 10ATM of water resistance, and a Quick Button, which acts as a customizable shortcut button. It’s basically an Apple Watch Ultra for Android.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, if you’re on a budget, there’s the $199.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24176939/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-price-specs\">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, which is essentially a rebadged Galaxy Watch 4. </p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is targeted at more outdoorsy folks with dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, and increased durability.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10290/gwultra_8.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Longer battery life than the regular Galaxy Watch</li><li>Double pinch is useful</li><li>Adds dual-frequency GPS and sleep apnea detection</li><li>Cheaper than the Apple Watch Ultra</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Where is Samsung in this? </li><li>The squircle chonk doesn’t fit small wrists</li><li>Sleep apnea feature is limited to Galaxy phones</li><li>AGEs metric is baffling</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1YL96ND/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#038;psc=1\"> $649.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://howl.me/cmMK5emkCWL\"> $649.99 at <strong>Samsung</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-titanium-smartwatch-47mm-lte-titanium-gray/6585557.p\"> $649.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p>The Samsung Health app also delivers a good overall fitness tracking experience, especially since you can enable turn-by-turn navigation for hiking and<strong> </strong>cycling activities. We weren’t too impressed with nightly SpO2 readings, but Samsung’s overall sleep tracking continues to improve. You also get built-in GPS, body composition analysis, irregular heart rate notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS features, and EKGs.&nbsp;Most recently, Samsung added a new Energy score, AI-powered wellness insights, FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, and a confusing AGEs Index metric for metabolic health. While the Energy score is broadly accurate, I found the AI-generated features to be hit or miss and the AGEs Index to be more gimmicky than useful. The latter feature is also limited to the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra.</p>\n\n<p>We don’t necessarily recommend the Galaxy Watches if you don’t have a Samsung phone. EKGs and sleep apnea detection<strong> </strong>require the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is limited to Samsung phones. You can work around it, but all Samsung watches work <em>best</em> with other Samsung devices. Samsung <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/691662/samsung-unpacked-july-ultra-foldable\">announced</a> a Galaxy Unpacked event on July 9th, and it may introduce new Galaxy Watches along with its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/618855/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaks-renders-thin-onleaks\">rumored</a> foldable phones.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"TFwXTK\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23818557/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review-bezels-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full Galaxy Watch 6 series review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"uuXdb5\">Best Android smartwatch for non-Samsung users</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Pixel Watch 3 (41mm, Bluetooth)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Pixel Watch 3 adds a host of new fitness features, brighter screens, and nifty Google integrations.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25617855/247234_Pixel_Watch_3_AKrales_0224.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>We finally get a bigger size!</li><li>Moderate battery improvements</li><li>Lots of neat Google integrations</li><li>Good running updates</li><li>Readiness and Cardio Load scores not locked behind paywall</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>It’s best with a Pixel phone</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-45mm-Smartwatch/dp/B0D9138ZXM\"> $349.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-smartwatch-with-obsidian-band-wi-fi-matte-black/6587431.p\"> $349.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_watch_3\"> $349.99 at <strong>Google</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;41mm, 45mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;31g for 41mm, 37g for 45mm /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Roughly 24 hours with AOD enabled /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:&nbsp;</strong>Always-on OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:&nbsp;</strong>Built-in GPS&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Safety Signal with Fitbit Premium /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $349.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is done playing catch-up. It’s an annoying truth that if you have a Samsung phone, a Samsung smartwatch is probably the best choice for you. However, for everyone else, I highly recommend the Pixel Watch 3.</p>\n\n<p>There are several updates to the Pixel Watch 3, but the gist is that it’s a more refined watch that also expands into new territory. One major update is that there are now two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. You get extra screen real estate on the larger watch, but the bezels are also smaller on the 41mm model. (If you’re trying to pick between sizes, I prefer the 45mm.) The displays are brighter as well, ranging from a minimum of 1 nit to a maximum of 2,000 nits.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25610299/247234_Pixel_Watch_3_AKrales_0205.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"The 45mm and 41mm Pixel Watch 3 in colorful boxes\" title=\"The 45mm and 41mm Pixel Watch 3 in colorful boxes\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 45mm model also wears small. The difference between the two sizes isn’t massive as far as wearability.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Health and fitness also get several updates, especially for runners. There’s a new Cardio Load metric that gauges the cardiovascular intensity of the exercises you’ve been doing over a set period of time. It’s similar to Garmin’s Training Load metric. You’re also given a Cardio Load target based on your fitness goals, readiness, and current activity. Runners also get a new dashboard full of form analysis metrics as well as the ability to program custom workouts. In addition, you can get AI-generated suggested workouts. And if you’re in Europe or the US, the Pixel Watch 3 can now detect if you no<strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/619929/google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-fda-clerance-smartwatch\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/619929/google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-fda-clerance-smartwatch\">longer have a pulse</a> and call emergency services.</p>\n\n<p>The Pixel Watch 3 also adds a bunch of nifty Google integrations. It’s excellent if you have a Google-powered smart home because you can now directly view and interact with your Nest Doorbell or camera feeds. You can also use the watch as a remote for your Google TV, and there are new Google Home Tile / complications that make controlling your home from your wrist a breeze. Also new are offline Google Maps, the ability to unlock Pixel phones, and a Call Assist feature that lets a caller know you need an extra minute to pick up your phone. A recent <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/694246/google-android-pixel-watch-3-bluetooth-6-sounding-tracking-wear-os-update\">software update</a> brought precise Bluetooth tracking to the device, so you can find it with “centimeter-level accuracy” with a device that supports Bluetooth 6.0. Google has committed to providing the Pixel Watch 3 with at <a href=\"https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/12799779\">least three years</a> of software updates, the next of which includes Wear OS 6 later this year.</p>\n\n<p>That said, while the Pixel Watch was initially framed as a watch for any Android phone, several updates this time around mean you’ll get the best experience with a Pixel phone. But compared to Samsung, there isn’t quite as much lock-in. Health features, for example, are available to everyone so long as you have a Fitbit account. Extra good news: Google removed certain metrics, like the Daily Readiness Score, from the Fitbit Premium paywall. Mostly, the features locked to Pixel phones are the Recorder app and things like the ability to unlock your phone with the watch.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to be mindful of is durability. While the domed display is beautiful, we cracked the screen on the original Pixel Watch <em>and</em> got deep scratches on the Pixel Watch 2. (Thankfully, we haven’t messed up the Pixel Watch 3.) Google doesn’t offer any repair options, but you can get the Preferred Care extended warranty if you want to be prepared should something happen. It’s not ideal since it’s limited to the US and Canada, but it’s a step in the right direction. </p>\n\n<p>In case you’re wondering if a Pixel Watch 4 will come out, it’s likely. As for when, we don’t know. Google hasn’t officially announced a new smartwatch, and it was absent from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/google-io\">this year’s I/O developer conference</a>, but it’s worth considering that this watch will probably get a follow-up in the coming months.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7hi5hI\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Read my full Google Pixel Watch 3 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"XToLsa\">Best alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>OnePlus Watch 2</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The OnePlus Watch 2 has Wear OS 4, multiday battery life, dual-frequency GPS, and helps fill the void left by Fossil exiting the Android smartwatch space.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25412030/247069_Oneplus_watch_2_AKrales_0069.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Praise be, the watch works</li><li>Long battery life</li><li>Launches with Google Assistant</li><li>Competitively priced</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No LTE option</li><li>Android only</li><li>Missing EKGs, fall detection</li><li>Only one size</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CV5YC5FV/\"> <strike>$299.99</strike> $249.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/us/buy-oneplus-watch-2\"> $299.99 at <strong>OnePlus (with code LUCKY25)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;47mm with 22mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;49g case, 80g with strap /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 100 hours in smart mode, 48 with AOD on, and 12 days in power-saving mode /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Dual-frequency GPS, Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, QZSS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $299.99 OnePlus Watch 2 is what a glow-up looks like. While the original <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features\">OnePlus Watch</a> was horrible, this watch helps fill the void that Fossil left when it said it was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052275/fossil-quitting-smartwatches-android-wear-os\">pulling out of Android smartwatches</a> — namely, a viable alternative to Google and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p>The 47mm case is big for petite wrists, and unfortunately, it only comes in one size, but it’s made of durable stainless steel and sapphire crystal. Plus, it houses a 500mAh battery. That, plus a dual-chip architecture and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081349/wear-os-4-oneplus-hybrid-wearables-smartwatches\">novel dual OS system</a>, results in super long battery life. How long a smartwatch lasts will, of course, depend on your individual usage, but I got nearly four days with normal use. That’s incredible for a flagship.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25379979/247069_Oneplus_watch_2_AKrales_0125.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close-up of the OnePlus Watch 2 on a red book\" title=\"Close-up of the OnePlus Watch 2 on a red book\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch 2 has stupendous battery life.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>It also has Wear OS 4, making it the only third-party Wear OS watch running the latest software (Watch 2 users <a href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3\">might receive</a> Wear OS 5 updates before September). It has Google Assistant from the get-go — a big achievement since that’s been a problem with other third-party Android watches. Plus, you get access to the Google Play Store for a robust app ecosystem. On the fitness side of things, OnePlus added dual-frequency GPS. That’s a plus if you’re outdoorsy and frequent challenging GPS environments like dense forests or crowded cities.</p>\n\n<p>The main things you’re giving up are LTE connectivity and some features like EKGs, atrial fibrillation detection, native period tracking, and fall detection. The lack of cellular is a bummer, as it means you really should keep your phone on you when you’re out and about. Still, the $300 price tag is a competitive one and may be worth the trade-off given battery life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, the OnePlus Watch 3 will ship with Wear OS 5, and will feature a rotating crown that actually scrolls, improved battery life, a better GPS antenna, and a bunch of new health features. That model will debut in early July. (In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/612965\">here’s my hands-on</a>.) You might want to keep in mind, however, that the Watch 3 is $50 more expensive. On the bright side, this also means we’ll probably see discounts on the remaining OnePlus Watch 2 inventory.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a88jY6\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables\">Read my full OnePlus Watch 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kw7Yhq\">Best fitness smartwatch for Android</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Mobvoi’s long-awaited TicWatch Pro 5 has superior battery life, excellent fitness tracking, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon W5 Plus chip.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24666157/236670_Mobvoi_TicWatch_Pro_5_AKrales_0045.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Close-up of person pressing the TicWatch Pro 5’s digital crown\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Truly multiday battery life</li><li>W5 Plus chip helps to futureproof</li><li>Good health tracking updates</li><li>The ULP display has an ingenious way of displaying heart rate zones</li><li>Digital crown!</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Why so many apps??</li><li>W5 Plus doesn’t get you a huge performance bump</li><li>No digital assistant</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.mobvoi.com/us/products/ticwatchpro5\"> <strike>$349.99</strike> $130 at <strong>Mobvoi</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"http://amazon.com/dp/B0BYS4KJV6/\"> <strike>$349.99</strike> $139.5 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;50mm with 24mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;44.3g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 80 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen and secondary ultra-low power display /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, Beidou /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Mobvoi’s TicWatch lineup has its devoted fans for a reason: super long battery life. The $349.99 TicWatch Pro 5 is no exception. It’s got an estimated 80 hours of battery life with standard use, a secondary ultra-low power display, and a massive (for a smartwatch you wear on your wrist, at least) 628mAh battery. I didn’t quite get 80 hours in my testing, but I did get a solid 48-60 hours with heavy GPS use. That outclasses most of the watches in this category (except the OnePlus Watch 2) and is useful for backpackers and endurance athletes. It might not hold a candle to a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22883556/garmin-fenix-7-epix-gps-smartwatches-outdoors-fitness\">top-of-the-line Garmin</a>, but it’s also a smarter watch for a fraction of the price.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life aside, the Pro 5 is a good option for fitness-focused people who aren’t keen on giving up smart capabilities for a Garmin or Polar. It’s also more durable. This time around, Mobvoi has also added a digital crown so you don’t have to worry about scrolling through menus with sweaty fingers. The flatter side button also reduces the risk of accidental presses.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24666161/236670_Mobvoi_TicWatch_Pro_5_AKrales_0091.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close up of the ULP display on the TicWatch Pro 5\" title=\"Close up of the ULP display on the TicWatch Pro 5\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The ULP display helps to extend battery life.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelias Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelias Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Pro 5 also has an ingenious method of displaying heart rate. When you lift up your arm, the backlight changes color depending on which heart rate zone you’re in. That means you can instantly gauge whether to up the intensity or slow your roll. The Pro 5 also adds new training metrics, like VO2 Max and recovery time.</p>\n\n<p>The TicWatch supports stress tracking, all-day blood oxygen monitoring, fatigue assessments, as well as atrial fibrillation and irregular heartbeat detection. For outdoorsy types, it also has access to multiple GNSS systems, and there’s a new barometer and compass app, as well as a one-tap measurement app that gives you a quick look at five metrics (heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, respiratory rate, and overall heart health).</p>\n\n<p>It’s also pretty capable on the productivity front. You get contactless payments, access to the Play Store, notifications, and the ability to take calls. <em>It runs on W5 Plus chip, which is a more powerful version of the chip inside the Google Pixel 3 and OnePlus Watch 2. This is a plus in terms of  hardware futureproofing</em>. <em>However, the watch received an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235843/at-long-last-wear-os-4-arrives-on-mobvoi-ticwatches\">update to Wear OS 4</a> over a year after its release, and has not commented on whether it will support Wear OS 5, much less Wear OS 6. Two other</em> major concerns are the 50mm case that may not suit smaller wrists and the lack of a digital assistant.</p>\n\n<p>The Pro 5 has also seen a steady price drop since the start of the year, and it’s regularly available for under $150.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KumW6f\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23733359/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-review-wear-os-3-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xyqJ1r\">Best hybrid smartwatch</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Withings ScanWatch Light</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Withings Scanwatch Light is a hybrid analog smartwatch that tracks the basics like steps and activities, while delivering up to 30 days of battery life.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25282427/247014_Withings_ScanWatch_2_Light_AKrales_0015.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Close up of Withings ScanWatch light\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Long battery life</li><li>Also gets you lots of compliments</li><li>Comfortable to wear</li><li>Great price</li><li>Adds period tracking</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Has fewer sensors than the ScanWatch 2</li><li>Again, the OLED display is tiny</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Light-Smartwatch-Monitoring/dp/B0CG9RZFLN/\"> $249.95 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/withings-scanwatch-light/-/A-93794516?preselect=90708670\"> $249.95 at <strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.withings.com/us/en/scanwatch-light/shop\"> $249.95 at <strong>Withings</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;37mm with 18mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;45g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 39 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED display /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Tethered GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Hybrid smartwatches are an excellent way to keep things simple and subtle. The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light gets you the basics like push notifications, timers, and alarms. On the health front, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS workouts. (That said, GPS is tethered from your phone, not built in.) The design reminds me of a classier Swatch, particularly if you get the more colorful options in a minty green or pale blue. But the big reason the Light has dethroned our previous pick, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22882401/garmin-vivomove-sport-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-wearables\">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a>, is its extra-long battery life. Withings estimates it lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, and I got pretty close to that in testing with 25 days. Despite the Vivomove’s more appealing $180 price tag, it only lasts about five days.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25282437/247014_Withings_ScanWatch_2_Light_AKrales_0117.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Overhead view of person wearing Withings ScanWatch 2 and ScanWatch Light\" title=\"Overhead view of person wearing Withings ScanWatch 2 and ScanWatch Light\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch 2 (left) is a fancier version of the Light and has a few more health features.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>If you want a bit more out of a hybrid, you can also opt for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Monitoring-Fitness-Compatible/dp/B0DJFWPCM9\">ScanWatch 2</a>. It’s an extra $100, but you get EKGs and atrial fibrillation detection, temperature sensors, SpO2 readings, and an altimeter for measuring elevation. It also looks a bit more elegant on the wrist, partly because of a secondary dial that tracks your daily step progress.</p>\n\n<p>If neither matches your style, the Vivomove Sport is still a good option that gets you access to Garmin’s in-depth platform. Its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23600040/garmin-vivomove-trend-review-hybrid-smartwatch-wearable\">Vivomove Trend</a> is a slightly more upscale option that also supports Qi charging.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mq3RA5\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24085043/withings-scanwatch-2-scanwatch-light-review-wearables-smartwatch\">Read my full Withings ScanWatch Light review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"EC2Hom\">Best platform-agnostic fitness smartwatch</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Garmin Venu 3S</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Garmin Venu 3S adds a new heart rate sensor, a wheelchair mode, and much-improved sleep tracking and nap detection. </div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25047628/236839_Garmin_Venu_3_AKrales_0021.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Person looking at Garmin Venu 3 on their wrist showing calendar widget.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Good battery life</li><li>Better sleep tracking and nap detection</li><li>EKG and AFib features</li><li>Can take calls and use your phone’s voice assistant</li><li>Audio meditation sessions done well</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Pricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatches</li><li>Limited third-party app ecosystem</li><li>No LTE capability</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CDC6Y617/\"> $445 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-venu-3s-gps-smartwatch-41-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-stainless-steel-and-french-gray/6551499.p?skuId=6551499\"> $449.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/873214/\"> $449.99 at <strong>Garmin</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;41mm with 18mm straps; 45mm with 22mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;8GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Garmin is best known for making rugged GPS watches that have excellent fitness features but aren’t so smart otherwise. But the $449.99 Venu 3 caters to people who want top-notch <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22985108/best-fitness-tracker\">fitness tracking</a> without sacrificing productivity features.</p>\n\n<p>It’s got a colorful and vibrant always-on OLED display and comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like its predecessor, the Venu 2 Plus, it also has a microphone and speaker so you can take and make calls directly from the wrist. It also has a clever workaround for digital assistants —&nbsp;it uses Bluetooth to work with whatever assistant is already on your phone. You’d think more fitness trackers would do this, but they don’t. It worked well in testing, though digital assistants aren’t always the smartest at understanding commands.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25047640/236839_Garmin_Venu_3_AKrales_0153.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Person wearing the Garmin Venu 3S while putting their hand in a jeans pocket.\" title=\"Person wearing the Garmin Venu 3S while putting their hand in a jeans pocket.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Venu 3 series is a little pricey, but it’s the smartest watch Garmin’s got to offer.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Venu 3 doesn’t have the best third-party app ecosystem, but it has Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music for offline playback. Android users can also send quick responses for texts, and the watch works with either iOS or Android for folks who want to keep their options open. It also has fall detection, live tracking, and contactless payments.</p>\n\n<p>As for health features, it has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables its FDA-cleared EKG app to detect atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, you get built-in GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, all of the advanced coaching features in the Garmin Connect app, and Garmin’s famous in-depth health data. The Venu 3 also improves sleep tracking with nap detection and adds audio-guided meditation sessions. There’s also a new wheelchair mode.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t the most hardcore Garmin that money can buy, but it’s definitely one of the smartest. The price is a bit high compared to most smartwatches, but by Garmin standards, it’s middle-of-the-pack. If you need a bigger screen, Garmin just released the Venu X1, a GPS smartwatch with a 51mm display. Garmin says it can last up to eight days per charge, and Pulse Ox sensor, but cannot take an EKG.

Normally, I don’t get compliments while wearing budget smartwatches, but I got <em>several</em> while wearing this one. </p>\n\n<p>While it doesn’t run Wear OS, its proprietary Zepp OS makes for a platform-agnostic smartwatch. Feature-wise, you get all the basics and then some. That includes things like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. You also get offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation, 160 different sport activity profiles, and a new strength training activity that automatically tracks reps. The Active 2 doesn’t have dual-frequency GPS, but it has the next best thing: access to all five of the major GNSS satellite systems. As far as health tracking goes, it also emphasizes trendy metrics like a readiness score and has a revamped sleep tracking algorithm. Battery life is estimated at about 10 days, though as a heavy user, I got around eight to nine in my testing. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257523_Amazfit_Active_2_AKrales_0080.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;This watch got me several compliments, which I don’t usually expect at this price point.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Something that sets the Active 2 apart at this price range is access to an AI assistant on wrist and AI chatbots within the Zepp app. The Zepp Flow assistant (on wrist) is a little finicky, but you can use it to control your watch’s on-device settings and basic queries like asking for the weather. The Zepp Aura AI bot costs an extra $77 yearly, and you can ask it to deliver insights into your readiness and sleep scores. I found it hit or miss, but at least it’s well-integrated into the app, snappy, and most importantly, optional. More useful is the Zepp Coach, which you can use to generate custom training plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All in all, I don’t have much to gripe about this watch, which is wild given how affordable it is. It certainly delivers an outsized bang for your buck.

Now there are more good options than ever — with more on the way soon.\nMuch like Android phones, this market is fragmented. Wear OS 5 is here for Samsung’s Galaxy Watches, Google’s Pixel Watch 3, and soon, the OnePlus Watch 3 when it finally ships later this month after a typo debacle all the way back in February. Several of these smartwatches will support Wear OS 6 when it’s released later this year, although some may get left behind.\nFeatured in this article\nBest for Samsung users: Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\nThe Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is an iterative but welcome update, with a rotating bezel, better battery life, and a larger display than previous models.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 at Amazon (43mm, BT)\n $399.99 at Best Buy (43mm, BT)\n $399.99 at Samsung (43mm, BT)\n\nBest for non-Samsung users: Google Pixel Watch 3\nThe Pixel Watch 3 adds a host of new fitness features, brighter screens, and nifty Google integrations.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 at Amazon (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Best Buy (41mm, Bluetooth)\n $349.99 at Google (41mm, Bluetooth)\n\nIf you’d rather wait until Wear OS settles down a bit, there are platform-agnostic smartwatches and fitness watches you can buy in the meantime. Otherwise, you’ll want to be aware of the Wear OS version powering your watch. Mobvoi, for instance, has generally been a step behind Google and Samsung in rolling out the latest version of Wear OS. You should also take note of whether the watch you want is using the latest processor, or a last-gen model.\nSo long as you keep the aforementioned caveats in mind, Android users have more smartwatch options than ever before. I’ve rounded up my top picks, but if none of these is the right fit, you can always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest smartwatch for Samsung phones\nBest Android smartwatch for non-Samsung users\nBest alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches\nBest fitness smartwatch for Android\nBest hybrid smartwatch\nBest platform-agnostic fitness smartwatch\nBest budget Android smartwatch\n\nBest smartwatch for Samsung phones\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic\nThe rotating bezel returns on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. While the updates are iterative, you now get Wear OS 4, One UI 5 Watch, larger batteries, and a larger display thanks to the 15 percent thinner bezel.\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter battery life\nBezels are 30 percent slimmer\nComes with Wear OS 4\nEverything is slightly improved from last year\n\nNot much has changed\nYou still get a better experience when paired with Samsung phones\nSlightly more expensive\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 at Amazon (43mm, BT)\n $399.99 at Best Buy (43mm, BT)\n $399.99 at Samsung (43mm, BT)\n\nSizes: 43mm, 47mm / Weight: 77g, 85g / Battery life: Up to 30 hours with AOD, 40 without AOD / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters, IP68 / Music storage: 16GB\nIf you have a Samsung phone, you’ll get the most mileage out of a Samsung smartwatch. And of the four watches Samsung has in its current lineup, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Although Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch 7 last July, there wasn’t a refresh for the Classic. That means you ought to be seeing some good deals for the Classic soon, if not already. It’s not often that I recommend a last-gen device, but such is my deep love for the physical rotating bezel. For what it’s worth, Android Central reports that that Samsung’s leaked Wear OS 6 plans include late 2025 updates for the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, as well as the Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE.\nIf you want the latest and greatest, the Galaxy Watch 7 offers an upgraded 3nm Exynos W1000 chip and a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor. It’s a marginal improvement over the 2023 models, but I don’t feel like Samsung introduced anything last year that requires having them. Mostly, I recommend the 7 if you prefer a smaller size, don’t care about the rotating bezel, and want something a smidge more futureproof.\nThe Classic’s rotating bezel is 15 percent thinner than the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The updated design is sleeker than its predecessor, and the larger display is easier on the eyes and is only slightly bigger at 43mm and 47mm. I have small wrists, but the 47mm was still quite comfortable for everyday wear. It launched with Wear OS 4, but currently runs on Wear OS 5, which introduced better battery life, and more useful watch face complications.  While I prefer the Classic, the base Watch 6 model may be the better option if you want a smaller, lighter, sleeker, and cheaper smartwatch.\nFor more outdoorsy folks, the $649.99 Galaxy Watch Ultra might be the more sensible choice. Of all Samsung’s watches, it has the best battery life, lasting around three days in our testing. (Though, we never got the full 100-hour estimated battery life.) It’s got dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, increased durability, 10ATM of water resistance, and a Quick Button, which acts as a customizable shortcut button. It’s basically an Apple Watch Ultra for Android.\nMeanwhile, if you’re on a budget, there’s the $199.99 Galaxy Watch FE, which is essentially a rebadged Galaxy Watch 4. \nSamsung Galaxy Watch Ultra\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is targeted at more outdoorsy folks with dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, and increased durability.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLonger battery life than the regular Galaxy Watch\nDouble pinch is useful\nAdds dual-frequency GPS and sleep apnea detection\nCheaper than the Apple Watch Ultra\n\nWhere is Samsung in this? \nThe squircle chonk doesn’t fit small wrists\nSleep apnea feature is limited to Galaxy phones\nAGEs metric is baffling\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $649.99 at Amazon\n $649.99 at Samsung\n $649.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe Samsung Health app also delivers a good overall fitness tracking experience, especially since you can enable turn-by-turn navigation for hiking and cycling activities. We weren’t too impressed with nightly SpO2 readings, but Samsung’s overall sleep tracking continues to improve. You also get built-in GPS, body composition analysis, irregular heart rate notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS features, and EKGs. Most recently, Samsung added a new Energy score, AI-powered wellness insights, FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, and a confusing AGEs Index metric for metabolic health. While the Energy score is broadly accurate, I found the AI-generated features to be hit or miss and the AGEs Index to be more gimmicky than useful. The latter feature is also limited to the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra.\nWe don’t necessarily recommend the Galaxy Watches if you don’t have a Samsung phone. EKGs and sleep apnea detection require the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is limited to Samsung phones. You can work around it, but all Samsung watches work best with other Samsung devices. Samsung announced a Galaxy Unpacked event on July 9th, and it may introduce new Galaxy Watches along with its rumored foldable phones.\nRead my full Galaxy Watch 6 series review.\nBest Android smartwatch for non-Samsung users\nPixel Watch 3 (41mm, Bluetooth)\nThe Pixel Watch 3 adds a host of new fitness features, brighter screens, and nifty Google integrations.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nWe finally get a bigger size!\nModerate battery improvements\nLots of neat Google integrations\nGood running updates\nReadiness and Cardio Load scores not locked behind paywall\n\nIt’s best with a Pixel phone\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 at Amazon\n $349.99 at Best Buy\n $349.99 at Google\n\nSizes: 41mm, 45mm / Weight: 31g for 41mm, 37g for 45mm / Battery life: Roughly 24 hours with AOD enabled / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Safety Signal with Fitbit Premium / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nThe $349.99 Google Pixel Watch 3 is done playing catch-up. It’s an annoying truth that if you have a Samsung phone, a Samsung smartwatch is probably the best choice for you. However, for everyone else, I highly recommend the Pixel Watch 3.\nThere are several updates to the Pixel Watch 3, but the gist is that it’s a more refined watch that also expands into new territory. One major update is that there are now two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. You get extra screen real estate on the larger watch, but the bezels are also smaller on the 41mm model. (If you’re trying to pick between sizes, I prefer the 45mm.) The displays are brighter as well, ranging from a minimum of 1 nit to a maximum of 2,000 nits.\nHealth and fitness also get several updates, especially for runners. There’s a new Cardio Load metric that gauges the cardiovascular intensity of the exercises you’ve been doing over a set period of time. It’s similar to Garmin’s Training Load metric. You’re also given a Cardio Load target based on your fitness goals, readiness, and current activity. Runners also get a new dashboard full of form analysis metrics as well as the ability to program custom workouts. In addition, you can get AI-generated suggested workouts. And if you’re in Europe or the US, the Pixel Watch 3 can now detect if you no longer have a pulse and call emergency services.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 also adds a bunch of nifty Google integrations. It’s excellent if you have a Google-powered smart home because you can now directly view and interact with your Nest Doorbell or camera feeds. You can also use the watch as a remote for your Google TV, and there are new Google Home Tile / complications that make controlling your home from your wrist a breeze. Also new are offline Google Maps, the ability to unlock Pixel phones, and a Call Assist feature that lets a caller know you need an extra minute to pick up your phone. A recent software update brought precise Bluetooth tracking to the device, so you can find it with “centimeter-level accuracy” with a device that supports Bluetooth 6.0. Google has committed to providing the Pixel Watch 3 with at least three years of software updates, the next of which includes Wear OS 6 later this year.\nThat said, while the Pixel Watch was initially framed as a watch for any Android phone, several updates this time around mean you’ll get the best experience with a Pixel phone. But compared to Samsung, there isn’t quite as much lock-in. Health features, for example, are available to everyone so long as you have a Fitbit account. Extra good news: Google removed certain metrics, like the Daily Readiness Score, from the Fitbit Premium paywall. Mostly, the features locked to Pixel phones are the Recorder app and things like the ability to unlock your phone with the watch.\nOne thing to be mindful of is durability. While the domed display is beautiful, we cracked the screen on the original Pixel Watch and got deep scratches on the Pixel Watch 2. (Thankfully, we haven’t messed up the Pixel Watch 3.) Google doesn’t offer any repair options, but you can get the Preferred Care extended warranty if you want to be prepared should something happen. It’s not ideal since it’s limited to the US and Canada, but it’s a step in the right direction. \nIn case you’re wondering if a Pixel Watch 4 will come out, it’s likely. As for when, we don’t know. Google hasn’t officially announced a new smartwatch, and it was absent from this year’s I/O developer conference, but it’s worth considering that this watch will probably get a follow-up in the coming months.\nRead my full Google Pixel Watch 3 review.\nBest alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches\nOnePlus Watch 2\nThe OnePlus Watch 2 has Wear OS 4, multiday battery life, dual-frequency GPS, and helps fill the void left by Fossil exiting the Android smartwatch space.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nPraise be, the watch works\nLong battery life\nLaunches with Google Assistant\nCompetitively priced\n\nNo LTE option\nAndroid only\nMissing EKGs, fall detection\nOnly one size\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $249.99 at Amazon\n $299.99 at OnePlus (with code LUCKY25)\n\nSizes: 47mm with 22mm straps / Weight: 49g case, 80g with strap / Battery life: Up to 100 hours in smart mode, 48 with AOD on, and 12 days in power-saving mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: Dual-frequency GPS, Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, QZSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nThe $299.99 OnePlus Watch 2 is what a glow-up looks like. While the original OnePlus Watch was horrible, this watch helps fill the void that Fossil left when it said it was pulling out of Android smartwatches — namely, a viable alternative to Google and Samsung.\nThe 47mm case is big for petite wrists, and unfortunately, it only comes in one size, but it’s made of durable stainless steel and sapphire crystal. Plus, it houses a 500mAh battery. That, plus a dual-chip architecture and novel dual OS system, results in super long battery life. How long a smartwatch lasts will, of course, depend on your individual usage, but I got nearly four days with normal use. That’s incredible for a flagship.\nIt also has Wear OS 4, making it the only third-party Wear OS watch running the latest software (Watch 2 users might receive Wear OS 5 updates before September). It has Google Assistant from the get-go — a big achievement since that’s been a problem with other third-party Android watches. Plus, you get access to the Google Play Store for a robust app ecosystem. On the fitness side of things, OnePlus added dual-frequency GPS. That’s a plus if you’re outdoorsy and frequent challenging GPS environments like dense forests or crowded cities.\nThe main things you’re giving up are LTE connectivity and some features like EKGs, atrial fibrillation detection, native period tracking, and fall detection. The lack of cellular is a bummer, as it means you really should keep your phone on you when you’re out and about. Still, the $300 price tag is a competitive one and may be worth the trade-off given battery life.\nThat said, the OnePlus Watch 3 will ship with Wear OS 5, and will feature a rotating crown that actually scrolls, improved battery life, a better GPS antenna, and a bunch of new health features. That model will debut in early July. (In the meantime, here’s my hands-on.) You might want to keep in mind, however, that the Watch 3 is $50 more expensive. On the bright side, this also means we’ll probably see discounts on the remaining OnePlus Watch 2 inventory.\nRead my full OnePlus Watch 2 review.\nBest fitness smartwatch for Android\nMobvoi TicWatch Pro 5\nMobvoi’s long-awaited TicWatch Pro 5 has superior battery life, excellent fitness tracking, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon W5 Plus chip.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTruly multiday battery life\nW5 Plus chip helps to futureproof\nGood health tracking updates\nThe ULP display has an ingenious way of displaying heart rate zones\nDigital crown!\n\nWhy so many apps??\nW5 Plus doesn’t get you a huge performance bump\nNo digital assistant\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 $130 at Mobvoi\n $349.99 $139.5 at Amazon\n\nSizes: 50mm with 24mm straps / Weight: 44.3g / Battery life: Up to 80 hours / Display type: OLED touchscreen and secondary ultra-low power display / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, Beidou / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nMobvoi’s TicWatch lineup has its devoted fans for a reason: super long battery life. The $349.99 TicWatch Pro 5 is no exception. It’s got an estimated 80 hours of battery life with standard use, a secondary ultra-low power display, and a massive (for a smartwatch you wear on your wrist, at least) 628mAh battery. I didn’t quite get 80 hours in my testing, but I did get a solid 48-60 hours with heavy GPS use. That outclasses most of the watches in this category (except the OnePlus Watch 2) and is useful for backpackers and endurance athletes. It might not hold a candle to a top-of-the-line Garmin, but it’s also a smarter watch for a fraction of the price.\nBattery life aside, the Pro 5 is a good option for fitness-focused people who aren’t keen on giving up smart capabilities for a Garmin or Polar. It’s also more durable. This time around, Mobvoi has also added a digital crown so you don’t have to worry about scrolling through menus with sweaty fingers. The flatter side button also reduces the risk of accidental presses.\nThe Pro 5 also has an ingenious method of displaying heart rate. When you lift up your arm, the backlight changes color depending on which heart rate zone you’re in. That means you can instantly gauge whether to up the intensity or slow your roll. The Pro 5 also adds new training metrics, like VO2 Max and recovery time.\nThe TicWatch supports stress tracking, all-day blood oxygen monitoring, fatigue assessments, as well as atrial fibrillation and irregular heartbeat detection. For outdoorsy types, it also has access to multiple GNSS systems, and there’s a new barometer and compass app, as well as a one-tap measurement app that gives you a quick look at five metrics (heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, respiratory rate, and overall heart health).\nIt’s also pretty capable on the productivity front. You get contactless payments, access to the Play Store, notifications, and the ability to take calls. It runs on W5 Plus chip, which is a more powerful version of the chip inside the Google Pixel 3 and OnePlus Watch 2. This is a plus in terms of  hardware futureproofing. However, the watch received an update to Wear OS 4 over a year after its release, and has not commented on whether it will support Wear OS 5, much less Wear OS 6. Two other major concerns are the 50mm case that may not suit smaller wrists and the lack of a digital assistant.\nThe Pro 5 has also seen a steady price drop since the start of the year, and it’s regularly available for under $150.\nRead my full Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 review.\nBest hybrid smartwatch\nWithings ScanWatch Light\nThe Withings Scanwatch Light is a hybrid analog smartwatch that tracks the basics like steps and activities, while delivering up to 30 days of battery life.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLong battery life\nAlso gets you lots of compliments\nComfortable to wear\nGreat price\nAdds period tracking\n\nHas fewer sensors than the ScanWatch 2\nAgain, the OLED display is tiny\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.95 at Amazon\n $249.95 at Target\n $249.95 at Withings\n\nSizes: 37mm with 18mm straps / Weight: 45g / Battery life: Up to 39 days / Display type: OLED display / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nHybrid smartwatches are an excellent way to keep things simple and subtle. The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light gets you the basics like push notifications, timers, and alarms. On the health front, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS workouts. (That said, GPS is tethered from your phone, not built in.) The design reminds me of a classier Swatch, particularly if you get the more colorful options in a minty green or pale blue. But the big reason the Light has dethroned our previous pick, the Garmin Vivomove Sport, is its extra-long battery life. Withings estimates it lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, and I got pretty close to that in testing with 25 days. Despite the Vivomove’s more appealing $180 price tag, it only lasts about five days.\nIf you want a bit more out of a hybrid, you can also opt for the ScanWatch 2. It’s an extra $100, but you get EKGs and atrial fibrillation detection, temperature sensors, SpO2 readings, and an altimeter for measuring elevation. It also looks a bit more elegant on the wrist, partly because of a secondary dial that tracks your daily step progress.\nIf neither matches your style, the Vivomove Sport is still a good option that gets you access to Garmin’s in-depth platform. Its Vivomove Trend is a slightly more upscale option that also supports Qi charging.\nRead my full Withings ScanWatch Light review.\nBest platform-agnostic fitness smartwatch\nGarmin Venu 3S\nThe Garmin Venu 3S adds a new heart rate sensor, a wheelchair mode, and much-improved sleep tracking and nap detection. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood battery life\nBetter sleep tracking and nap detection\nEKG and AFib features\nCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistant\nAudio meditation sessions done well\n\nPricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatches\nLimited third-party app ecosystem\nNo LTE capability\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $445 at Amazon\n $449.99 at Best Buy\n $449.99 at Garmin\n\nSizes: 41mm with 18mm straps; 45mm with 22mm straps / Weight: 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / Battery life: Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\nGarmin is best known for making rugged GPS watches that have excellent fitness features but aren’t so smart otherwise. But the $449.99 Venu 3 caters to people who want top-notch fitness tracking without sacrificing productivity features.\nIt’s got a colorful and vibrant always-on OLED display and comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like its predecessor, the Venu 2 Plus, it also has a microphone and speaker so you can take and make calls directly from the wrist. It also has a clever workaround for digital assistants — it uses Bluetooth to work with whatever assistant is already on your phone. You’d think more fitness trackers would do this, but they don’t. It worked well in testing, though digital assistants aren’t always the smartest at understanding commands.\nThe Venu 3 doesn’t have the best third-party app ecosystem, but it has Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music for offline playback. Android users can also send quick responses for texts, and the watch works with either iOS or Android for folks who want to keep their options open. It also has fall detection, live tracking, and contactless payments.\nAs for health features, it has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables its FDA-cleared EKG app to detect atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, you get built-in GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, all of the advanced coaching features in the Garmin Connect app, and Garmin’s famous in-depth health data. The Venu 3 also improves sleep tracking with nap detection and adds audio-guided meditation sessions. There’s also a new wheelchair mode.\nThis isn’t the most hardcore Garmin that money can buy, but it’s definitely one of the smartest. The price is a bit high compared to most smartwatches, but by Garmin standards, it’s middle-of-the-pack. If you need a bigger screen, Garmin just released the Venu X1, a GPS smartwatch with a 51mm display. Garmin says it can last up to eight days per charge, and Pulse Ox sensor, but cannot take an EKG. The Venu X1 is available for $749.99 at Amazon and Best Buy.\nRead my full Garmin Venu 3S review.\nBest budget Android smartwatch\nAmazfit Active 2\nThe Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStacked feature set for the price\nLooks spiffy\nGood battery life\n\nTouchscreen and voice commands are finicky\nCan’t edit workouts\nAI chatbots are meh\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 at Walmart\n $99.99 at Amazfit\n\nSize: 43mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 29.5g for standard, 31.7g for premium / Battery life: Up to 10 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: Five GNSS systems / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nAmazfit’s made a name for itself making budget wearables that punch far above their weight. The $99.99 Amazfit Active 2 is no exception. \nThe Active 2 is a surprisingly spiffy watch considering its price. The standard version has a stainless steel case with tempered glass, and if you shell out $50 extra, you can get the premium model with sapphire crystal and an extra leather strap at Amazon and Amazfit. Normally, I don’t get compliments while wearing budget smartwatches, but I got several while wearing this one. \nWhile it doesn’t run Wear OS, its proprietary Zepp OS makes for a platform-agnostic smartwatch. Feature-wise, you get all the basics and then some. That includes things like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. You also get offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation, 160 different sport activity profiles, and a new strength training activity that automatically tracks reps. The Active 2 doesn’t have dual-frequency GPS, but it has the next best thing: access to all five of the major GNSS satellite systems. As far as health tracking goes, it also emphasizes trendy metrics like a readiness score and has a revamped sleep tracking algorithm. Battery life is estimated at about 10 days, though as a heavy user, I got around eight to nine in my testing. \nSomething that sets the Active 2 apart at this price range is access to an AI assistant on wrist and AI chatbots within the Zepp app. The Zepp Flow assistant (on wrist) is a little finicky, but you can use it to control your watch’s on-device settings and basic queries like asking for the weather. The Zepp Aura AI bot costs an extra $77 yearly, and you can ask it to deliver insights into your readiness and sleep scores. I found it hit or miss, but at least it’s well-integrated into the app, snappy, and most importantly, optional. More useful is the Zepp Coach, which you can use to generate custom training plans.\nAll in all, I don’t have much to gripe about this watch, which is wild given how affordable it is. It certainly delivers an outsized bang for your buck. Just make sure you wipe off any sweaty fingers, since its touchscreen doesn’t handle them well.\nRead my full Amazfit Active 2 review.\nUpdate, July 1st: Adjusted pricing/availability, and updated the copy to reflect recent happenings in the space.

But a last-minute amendment eliminated a proposal to impose a new excise tax on solar and wind projects, which industry groups and advocates warned could have done even more to cut jobs and raise electricity bills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fate of renewable energy projects — many of them in Republican districts — was a major sticking point that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/30/the-gop-war-over-clean-energy-comes-to-head-at-vote-a-rama-00433839\">nearly stopped</a> GOP lawmakers from reaching an agreement on the “<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1\">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>” that’s a key pillar of Donald Trump’s agenda. As passed, the Senate bill could have wide-ranging effects on many Americans’ lives, including cuts to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406392/trump-republicans-tax-bill-reconciliation-medicaid\">Medicaid and food assistance programs</a>, a spectrum auction that could slow down <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/694479/senate-bill-reduce-capacity-6ghz-wifi-band\">Wi-Fi speeds</a>, massive funding increases for Trump&#8217;s mass deportation campaign, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/30/upshot/senate-republican-megabill.html\">much more</a>.

However, before we dive in, it’s worth noting that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/685299/amazon-prime-day-2025-dates-when\">Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale will kick off on July 8th</a>. Amazon says it will offer a 25 percent discount on select e-readers like the Kindle Scribe and Kindle Kids — as well as the Kindle Essentials bundle&nbsp;— so it may be worth holding out. But if you’d rather not wait, here are the best deals available now.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25840919/257516_best_ebook_reader_SVasani_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A hand holding the 2024 Kindle.\" title=\"A hand holding the 2024 Kindle.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The entry-level Kindle remains the smallest e-reader Amazon offers, one that’s available in either black or green.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"jqPttv\">The best Kindle (2024) deals</h2>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ubZzEN\">What does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In case you missed it, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271197/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-e-reader-12th-gen-2024\">announced a new entry-level Kindle</a> in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23409106/amazon-kindle-2022-e-reader-review-test-price-specs-features\">2022 model</a>. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amazon-kindle-16-gb-2024-black/6599466.p\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/amazon-kindle-6-e-reader-2024/-/A-93604795?preselect=91563144#lnk=sametab\">Target</a> for its full retail price of $109.99.&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kindle (2024)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Amazon’s new entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C.

Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the&nbsp;<em>Percy Jackson</em> and&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>&nbsp;series — at no additional cost.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off).

You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n \n\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price. However, before we dive in, it’s worth noting that Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale will kick off on July 8th. Amazon says it will offer a 25 percent discount on select e-readers like the Kindle Scribe and Kindle Kids — as well as the Kindle Essentials bundle — so it may be worth holding out. But if you’d rather not wait, here are the best deals available now.\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?\nAmazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\nIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the base Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $109.99. \nKindle (2024)\nAmazon’s new entry-level Kindle retains a six-inch, 300ppi display and USB-C. It’s both brighter and faster than its predecessor, however, and features longer battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $109.99 at Amazon\n $109.99 at Best Buy\n $109.99 at Target\n\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target at its full price of $129.99.\nKindle Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s Kindle Kids is identical to the standard Kindle — meaning it packs a 300ppi display and support for USB-C charging — but comes with a case, an extended two-year warranty, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 at Amazon\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n $129.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Unfortunately, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, though, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.\nKindle Paperwhite (2024)\nAmazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance. It also boasts longer battery life than the previous model, retains IPX8 waterproofing, and includes a USB-C port. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.99 at Amazon (ad-supported)\n $159.99 at Best Buy (ad-supported)\n $159.99 at Target (ad-supported)\n\n\n2024 Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle (with ads)\nThe seven-inch Kindle Paperwhite features a larger display and faster performance than Amazon’s entry-level ebook reader.

It’s only available at Amazon and Best Buy right now for its typical retail price of $199.99, though you can pick it up at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off). It’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in black, green, or pink for $257.97 ($25 off).\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (2024)\nThe premium Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition offers the same design and performance as the standard model but with more storage and support for wireless charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199.99 at Amazon \n $199.99 at Best Buy \n\n\nKindle Paperwhite Signature Edition Essentials Bundle\nAmazon’s step-up Kindle Paperwhite bundle includes a Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, a wireless charging dock, and your choice of either a fabric or plant-based cover.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $276.97 $251.97 at Amazon (fabric cover)\n $282.97 $257.97 at Amazon (leather cover)\n\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers optional parental controls. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids recently dropped to as low as $139.99 ($40 off) in advance of Prime Day, but right now, you can only purchase for its full retail price of $179.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nKindle Paperwhite Kids (2024)\nAmazon’s kid-friendly Paperwhite is the same as the standard Paperwhite, but it’s ad-free and comes with the added benefits of a two-year hardware protection plan, six months of Amazon Kids Plus, and a choice of three kid-friendly covers. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Amazon\n $179.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 at Target\n\n\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nLike its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.\nPreviously, we’ve seen the entry-level Kindle Scribe go for as low as $299.99 ($100 off). However, currently, you can only pick up the base model for its full retail price of $399.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nIf you’re keen on a deal, you can pick up the base Scribe as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $444.97 ($55 off) or a “premium” leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off). Alternatively, the 64GB version is available with the same accessories and a premium leather cover for $504.97 ($65 off).\nRead our Kindle Scribe (2024) review.\nKindle Scribe (2024)\nThe latest Kindle Scribe is a 10.2-inch e-reader with a stylus for taking notes.
