Apple’s newest pair of wireless earbuds leverage a comfortable open-ear design and some of the AirPods Pro’s best features, including adaptive audio, conversation awareness, and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. The noise cancellation also performs surprisingly well despite the open-style build, helping block low-frequency noises from airplane cabins and city traffic. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The standard <strong>AirPods 4</strong> lack a lot of the features found on the step-up model, but they’re available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-4/11381374703\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airpods-4-white/6447384.p?skuId=6447384\">Best Buy</a> right now for a mere $89 ($40 off), which is an all-time low. Although you don’t get conversation awareness or Apple’s transparency mode, the standard AirPods 4 offer the same comfortable design and sound, IPX4 water resistance, and up to five hours of continuous playback on a single charge. They also support Apple’s voice isolation feature, so you’ll sound nice and clear on calls.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Bose Ultra Open Earbuds</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Bose Ultra Open use an open design that lightly grips your ear, with tech that can pipe audio directly into your ear canals.

The earbuds offer decent sound quality, a comfortable design, and effective noise cancellation for the price. They lack some notable features, such as wireless charging and multipoint Bluetooth, though at just $54.99, they make for an excellent pair of entry-level earbuds. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23954073/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you want something more premium, the <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</strong> are down to $166.24 (about $84 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7/\">Amazon</a>, which is the lowest price we’ve seen yet. Samsung’s flagship earbuds don’t win any design points, but they offer excellent sound quality, a crisp transparency mode, and voice commands that are actually useful. While the earbuds are mostly a win, the active noise cancellation isn’t quite as robust as what you get from the AirPods Pro or Google’s Pixel Buds Pro. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24265270/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Sony LinkBuds Fit</strong> are down to around $128 ($71 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGVWF79V/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-linkbuds-fit-true-wireless-noise-canceling-earbuds-black/6594431.p?skuId=6594431\">Best Buy</a>, which is their lowest price to date. The earbuds feature “Air Fitting Supporters” that sit inside your ear, providing a more comfortable fit during extended use. They also offer ANC and ambient sound modes, plus 5.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include multipoint Bluetooth and IPX4 water resistance, making them a solid option for the gym.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Nothing Ear (a)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same general design as the company’s previous earbuds — but you can get these in a snazzy yellow. They include ANC, more than decent sound quality, and other features like multipoint for just under $100. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133464/nothing-ear-a-specs-price-hands-on\">Read our impressions</a>.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25406199/DSCF6920.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of new earbuds from Nothing.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Ear-Integration-Cancelling-Equaliser/dp/B0D2XYTB85/\"> <strike>$99</strike> $69 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.nothing.tech/products/ear-a\"> <strike>$99</strike> $69 at <strong>Nothing</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>CMF Buds Pro 2</strong> are available starting at $47 ($22 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Pro-Cancelling-Technology/dp/B0D81S532L/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://us.nothing.tech/products/cmf-buds-pro-2?Colour=Orange\">Nothing</a>, matching their best price to date.

These earbuds use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose, so they’re basically low-end Bose earbuds in disguise. That means you can expect a well-balanced sound, along with up to 40 hours of battery life, decent active noise cancellation, and IPX4 water resistance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other than the Beats Studio Buds Plus above, there aren’t a ton of reputable pairs of wireless earbuds that rely on a see-through design.

Unsurprisingly, there are also steep discounts available on a wealth of wireless headphones and earbuds, including the best prices yet on the latest AirPods Pro, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2, and Nothing’s budget-friendly Ear (a).\nWe’ve rounded up the best Prime Day discounts on some of our favorite headphones and earbuds from Apple, Beats, Bose, Sony, and more. While this is technically a Prime Day-focused roundup, we’ve included retailers outside of Amazon that are matching these discounts, so you don’t have to sign up for a Prime membership to save.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest earbud deals\nBest headphone deals\nBest for running or working out\n\nBest earbud deals\nAirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C\nThe second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $149 at Amazon\n $249.99 $149 at Walmart\n $249.99 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\n\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\nSignificantly smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer stronger noise cancellation, a crystal clear transparency mode, and lengthy battery life. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $160.54 at Amazon\n $229 $160.55 at Best Buy\n $229 $189 at Google Store\n\nDon’t like the sealed feeling of silicone tips? The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation are also down to an all-time low of $119 ($60 off) at Amazon and Walmart. Apple’s newest pair of wireless earbuds leverage a comfortable open-ear design and some of the AirPods Pro’s best features, including adaptive audio, conversation awareness, and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. The noise cancellation also performs surprisingly well despite the open-style build, helping block low-frequency noises from airplane cabins and city traffic. Read our review.\nThe standard AirPods 4 lack a lot of the features found on the step-up model, but they’re available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy right now for a mere $89 ($40 off), which is an all-time low. Although you don’t get conversation awareness or Apple’s transparency mode, the standard AirPods 4 offer the same comfortable design and sound, IPX4 water resistance, and up to five hours of continuous playback on a single charge. They also support Apple’s voice isolation feature, so you’ll sound nice and clear on calls.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds\nThe Bose Ultra Open use an open design that lightly grips your ear, with tech that can pipe audio directly into your ear canals. They’re an interesting and effective alternative to bone-conduction headphones, serving a similar purpose but unable to match the satisfying sound of traditional earbuds.

Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $198 at Amazon\n $299.99 $199.99 at Best Buy\n $299.99 $199.99 at Target\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds FE are an affordable pair of wireless earbuds with ANC, and now they’re down to $52.24 ($47.45 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is an all-time low. The earbuds offer decent sound quality, a comfortable design, and effective noise cancellation for the price. They lack some notable features, such as wireless charging and multipoint Bluetooth, though at just $54.99, they make for an excellent pair of entry-level earbuds. Read our review.\nIf you want something more premium, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are down to $166.24 (about $84 off) at Amazon, which is the lowest price we’ve seen yet. Samsung’s flagship earbuds don’t win any design points, but they offer excellent sound quality, a crisp transparency mode, and voice commands that are actually useful. While the earbuds are mostly a win, the active noise cancellation isn’t quite as robust as what you get from the AirPods Pro or Google’s Pixel Buds Pro. Read our review.\nThe Sony LinkBuds Fit are down to around $128 ($71 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is their lowest price to date. The earbuds feature “Air Fitting Supporters” that sit inside your ear, providing a more comfortable fit during extended use. They also offer ANC and ambient sound modes, plus 5.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. Other features include multipoint Bluetooth and IPX4 water resistance, making them a solid option for the gym.\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same general design as the company’s previous earbuds — but you can get these in a snazzy yellow. They include ANC, more than decent sound quality, and other features like multipoint for just under $100. Read our impressions.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $69 at Amazon\n $99 $69 at Nothing\n\nThe CMF Buds Pro 2 are available starting at $47 ($22 off) from Amazon and Nothing, matching their best price to date. The inexpensive buds come loaded with features, including active noise cancellation, ChatGPT integration, and up to 6.5 hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled. They also come with a case that features a customizable smart dial, allowing you to adjust the volume, control noise cancellation, and mute your mic during meetings.\nThe Skullcandy Method 360 ANC are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $75.99 ($54 off), an all-time low. These earbuds use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose, so they’re basically low-end Bose earbuds in disguise. That means you can expect a well-balanced sound, along with up to 40 hours of battery life, decent active noise cancellation, and IPX4 water resistance.\nOther than the Beats Studio Buds Plus above, there aren’t a ton of reputable pairs of wireless earbuds that rely on a see-through design. The newer WF-C710N do, however, and they’ve reached a new low price of $78 ($41 off) at Amazon and Walmart for Prime Day. What’s more, the budget-minded earbuds also borrow some tricks from Sony’s pricier earbuds, including improved noise cancellation and battery life, an automatic pause feature, and touch buttons that allow you to control playback without whipping out your phone.\nBest headphone deals\nAirPods Max (USB-C)\nThe revised AirPods Max are much like the original model from 2020, but now with new color options and a USB-C port instead of Lightning.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 $429.99 at Amazon\n $549.99 $449.99 at Best Buy\n\n\nSony WH-1000XM6\nSony’s latest pair of flagship headphones offer improved comfort, better noise cancellation, and the ability to charge while in use. They even fold down for travel, which can’t be said about the last-gen XM5. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 $428 at Amazon\n $449.99 $429.99 at Best Buy\n $449.99 $429.99 at Sony\n\nSony’s newer WH-1000XM6 are our No. 1 pick for the best ANC headphones, but the prior model remains an excellent alternative at around $248, their current price at Amazon, or $299 at Best Buy and at Sony’s online storefront. The XM5 still offer top-tier noise cancellation and superb sound, along with a helpful transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth support, and other handy features. The only real downside, aside from the plasticky build, is the fact that they don’t fold down like the XM4 and this year’s XM6. Read our review.\nThe las-last-gen Sony WH-1000XM4 continue to impress despite being a few generations old — and they’re currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $193 ($155 off), their lowest price in weeks. They still offer great sound, 30 hours of battery life, and a comfortable listening experience. Plus, they offer something the XM5 doesn’t have: the ability to fold down for easier transportation. Read our review.\nIf you’re looking for something more budget-friendly, the Sony WH-CH520 are down to around $38 ($22 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, matching their all-time low. The on-ear headphones deliver up to 50 hours of battery life, making them perfect for long flights or road trips across the country. They also boast a built-in mic for making hands-free calls and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to connect them to two devices simultaneously.\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones.

Whether you need a model with self-extending arms that pulls double duty by scrubbing floors and drying itself, or a basic, budget-friendly option for everyday tidying, this year’s deals offer something for every home and budget.\nHere, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day discounts on robot vacuums from popular brands like Roborock, Dreame, Eufy, and more, so you can easily find the perfect one to fit your needs. To make sure everybody gets a chance at saving, we’ve included retailers outside of Amazon that are matching these discounts, meaning you don’t need to pay for a Prime membership to take advantage of many of these deals.\nFeatured deals\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid: Dreame X40 Ultra\nThe Dreame X40 features 12,000Pa of suction power and the unique ability to remove and reattach its own mop pads. The mops can also swing out and reach under low furniture, allowing it to clean spots most bots miss.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $699.99 at Amazon \n $1499.99 $799.99 at Dreame\n\nBest budget option: Tapo RV30 Max Plus\nTapo’s RV30 Max Plus is a relatively inexpensive robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $199.99 at Amazon\n $299.99 $209.99 at TP-Link (discount applied at checkout)\n\nA former runner-up: Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop does a swinging, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” It also self-empties its own bin, although you need to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $369.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $369.99 at Best Buy\n\nA newer option: Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20\nEufy’s all-in-one station empties, washes, dries, and refills the Omni C20 between cleanings. The vac also offers 7,000Pa of suction, a rolling brush, a side brush, and a pro-detangle comb to handle debris and unwanted pet hair.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $379.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $379.99 at Eufy (with code WS7DV2EUJHXX)\n\nThe Roborock S8 Max Ultra is $799.99 ($800 off) at Amazon, which beats its previous best price to date. It’s very similar to the MaxV Ultra and offers dual rubber roller brushes, excellent AI-powered obstacle avoidance, and sonic mopping. However, it offers a lower 8,000Pa suction and lacks support for voice assistants. There’s no camera either, which is nice for privacy but not so nice when it comes to obstacle avoidance.\nThe Roborock S8 Plus, one of our favorite budget-friendly robovac / mop hybrids, is on sale for $349.99 ($650 off) at Amazon, which is it lowest price yet. It comes with an auto-empty dock and features a powerful vibrating mop that scrubs floors and can lift itself to avoid getting low-pile rugs wet. The robovac’s dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa suction also do a solid job of cleaning up both carpets and hard floors, while AI-assisted obstacle detection helps it navigate around everyday clutter.\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nOur favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation. It also features an auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $199.99 at Amazon\n $299.99 $209.99 at TP-Link (code applied at checkout)\n\n\nDreame X40 Ultra\nWith a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $699.99 at Amazon (for Prime members)\n $1499.99 $799.99 at Dreame\n\nThe Dreame L20 Ultra robovac / mop hybrid is selling for $539.98 ($460 off) at Amazon, which is nearly its lowest price to date. The auto-emptying vacuum isn’t as powerful as the X40 above and lacks self-extending arms for vacuuming, but it does have a self-extending mop that can reach into corners and refill its own water tank. The robovac is also capable of automatically detaching its mop pads when transitioning to carpet and, with 7,000Pa suction and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, it’s a great vacuum for sucking up dirt and debris, too.\nThe Dreame L10s Ultra is down to $399.99 ($500 off) at Amazon, matching its all-time low price. The robovac / mop hybrid delivers somewhat strong suction of 5,300Pa and features dual oscillating mops that it can wash and dry with its base. It can empty its dustbin and refill its water tanks on its own, providing up to two months of nearly hands-free cleaning. Equipped with AI navigation that uses both a camera and lidar, the L10s Ultra also lets you access a live camera feed through its app — so it can also serve as a pet monitor.\nNarwal’s Freo Z Ultra is on sale for $849.99, down from $1,499.99, at Amazon. The robovac / mop hybrid’s equipped with dual cameras and two AI chips that work together in real time to recognize objects and adapt on the fly, whether that means steering clear of pet waste, deciding how close to get to furniture, or switching to mop-only mode when it detects a wet spill.\nEufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20\nEufy’s all-in-one station empties, washes, dries, and refills the Omni C20 between cleanings. The vac also offers 7,000Pa of suction, a rolling brush, a side brush, and a pro-detangle comb to handle debris and unwanted pet hair.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $379.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $379.99 at Eufy (with code WS7DV2EUJHXX)\n\nThe Eufy RoboVac 11S Max is a good bump-and-roll bot that is on sale at Amazon for just $139.99 ($110 off), which is one of its better prices to date. This basic robot vacuum may lack some of the advanced features of pricier models, but it nails the essentials with decent 2,000Pa suction power and a large 600ml dustbin. It operates quietly and doesn’t rely on Wi-Fi, so there’s no need to deal with a smartphone app. Instead, you can control it directly using the onboard button or the included remote, which also lets you set cleaning schedules for added convenience (and remotely steer it, in case it’s not getting the spots you want it to get).\nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop mops very well — doing a swinging, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” However, you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops, as it only self-empties in vacuum mode and can only avoid larger objects.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $369.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $369.99 at Best Buy\n $699.99 $369.99 at Shark\n\nThe Shark Ion is on sale for $149.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, which is $30 shy of its best price to date. The excellent bump-and-roll bot is surprisingly effective, thanks to a hybrid bristle-and-plastic roller brush that resists tangles better than standard bristle brushes.

The Apple Watch Series 10 and Amazfit Active 2, two of the best smartwatches we’ve tested, are down to their lowest prices ever at Amazon. We don’t expect to see their prices this low until Black Friday or Cyber Monday, but here we are. Just remember, this is your last day to take advantage of these deals. \nThese gadgets can help make the journey into becoming healthier a little easier by tracking your sleep, step count, heart rate, and exercise info instead of you trying to track it manually. They also allow you to check notifications from your wrist to avoid having to pick up your smartphone as often throughout the day. If you’ve been curious about giving wearables a try, you’ll find the best deals from Amazon and other retailers below. There’s no time like the present to get started on your fitness journey.\nApple Watch Series 10 (GPS)\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s thinner and lighter than its predecessors, yet it charges faster and features the same fitness and wellness features. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $279 at Amazon (42mm)\n $399 $279 at Walmart (42mm)\n $429 $309 at Amazon (46mm)\n\n\nAmazfit Active 2\nThe Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $79.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $79.99 at Amazfit\n $99.99 $84.99 at Walmart\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 hasn’t sunk below $700 in a few months, but during Prime Day, you can snag it at Amazon and Best Buy for $649.99. This beats its previous low by $30. Read our review.\nGoogle Pixel Watch 3\nGoogle’s new Pixel Watch 3 is bigger and brighter than its predecessor. It also features more advanced running capabilities, offline Google Maps functionality, and deeper integration with other Google devices. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 $237.49 at Amazon (41mm, Wi-Fi)\n $349.99 $269.99 at Best Buy\n $399.99 $284.99 at Amazon (45mm, Wi-Fi)\n\nIf $249 is still too expensive, don’t write off the Pixel Watch 2. The cellular version is on sale at Amazon for $179.99 ($120 off). Its battery life isn’t as good as the Pixel Watch 3, and it’s missing a few features, but it’s otherwise a solid alternative if you’re trying to save a little cash. Read our review.\nIf you have your eyes set on a Samsung smartwatch, it’s a good time to grab the Galaxy Watch 7, which is matching its previous low of $246.99 at Amazon in the 44mm configuration with LTE. Read our review.\nThe non-LTE, 44mm Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition is down to $199.99 ($130 off) at Amazon, which is a steep price drop compared to its previous low of $279.99.\nThe Samsung Galaxy Ring is on sale at Amazon in multiple sizes for $299.99 ($100 off), which beats its previous low price by $50. It’s a solid, subscription-free first attempt at a smart ring from Samsung, with good hardware and long battery life. It’s Android-only, however, and it’s best paired with a Samsung phone. Read our review.\nThe Garmin Lily 2 has returned to its all-time low of $199.99 ($50 off) at Amazon. While Garmin makes plenty of trackers for enthusiast fitness folks, the Lily 2 is a more pared-back experience for casual users. I don’t say that condescendingly; The Verge’s Victoria Song praised its limitations during a vacation.\nOura Ring 4\nThe Oura Ring 4 is slimmer and more accurate than its predecessor, while adding new AI-powered tools and longer battery life. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 $296.65 at Amazon\n $349 $297 at Best Buy\n $349 $296.65 at Oura\n\n\nFitbit Charge 6\nThe Fitbit Charge 6 features a haptic side button, an improved heart rate algorithm, turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps, and the ability to broadcast your heart rate on certain Bluetooth gym equipment. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.95 $99.99 at Amazon\n $159.95 $109.95 at Best Buy\n $159.95 $109.95 at Google \n\n\nFitbit Inspire 3\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is a minimalist fitness band that delivers notifications and tracks your activity on a bright OLED screen.

Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $149 at Amazon\n $249 $149 at Walmart\n $249.99 $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nYou can buy the latest AirPods Max at Amazon for $429.99 ($80 off), which is about $30 shy of their lowest price to date. The luxe over-ear headphones offer great sound with support for lossless audio, and their active noise cancellation comes close to matching top-tier alternatives from Sony and Bose. They also feature a remarkably natural-sounding transparency mode, deep integration with other Apple devices, and up to 20 hours of battery life with ANC turned on. Read our original review.\nApple EarPods (USB-C)\nApple’s wired earbuds are comfortable, offer great microphone quality for the price, and feature a built-in remote for controlling audio playback.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19 $15.99 at Amazon\n $19 $15.99 at Walmart\n\n\nAirPods 4\nApple’s AirPods 4 are the latest update to its base-model wireless earbuds.

Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $89 at Amazon\n $129 $89 at Walmart\n $179 $119 at Amazon (with ANC)\n\nThe AirPods 4 with ANC are currently on sale for $119 ($60 off) at Amazon and Walmart, which blows their previous best-ever price out of the water. Apple’s step-up earbuds are identical to the standard AirPods 4 but include active noise cancellation, though it’s not quite as effective as that of the latest AirPods Pro. They also offer a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a case with a built-in speaker that makes tracking easy via Apple’s Find My feature. Read our review.\nIf you don’t need active noise cancellation, the Beats Solo 4 are also on sale for around $97.99 ($102 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and $99.99 at Target. The comfortable headphones build upon the prior model with better, bass-rich sound and support for spatial audio. They also now offer lossless audio via USB-C and an extended battery life of 50 hours. Read our review.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\nThe latest pair of Beats earbuds are a no-brainer for athletes. They pack fantastic sound and thumping bass, along with active noise cancellation, IPX4 water resistance, and heart rate monitoring. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $179.95 at Amazon\n $249 $179.95 at Walmart\n $249 $179.99 at Best Buy\n\nYou can buy the Beats Studio Pro for around $169.95, down from $349.99, at Amazon, Target, and Best Buy. The over-ear headphones boast noticeably improved noise cancellation and sound over their predecessor, along with support for lossless audio over USB-C. And, like many other Beats headphones and earbuds, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. Read our review.\nThe best iPad deals\n11-inch iPad Air M3\nThe latest 11-inch iPad Air features Apple’s fast M3 chip with GPU upgrades like dynamic caching for smoother performance in demanding apps. It also supports the Apple Pencil Pro and the new Magic Keyboard, which features a larger build and a 14-key function row. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 $479 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n $599 $579 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)\n $899 $779 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)\n\nFor something bigger, you can save on the larger 13-inch version of the M3-powered iPad Air with 128GB of storage, which costs $679 (down from $799) at Amazon. It’s identical to the 11-inch model in terms of performance and features, just with a more spacious display and better speakers. Read our review.\nYou can buy the latest iPad with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart starting at $279 ($70 off), which beats its best price by $20. The 11th-gen model is a pretty minor upgrade over the 2022 iPad with twice as much base storage and an A16 Bionic chip, which, while faster, doesn’t support the AI-based Apple Intelligence features. Read our review.\n2024 iPad Mini\nThe seventh-gen iPad Mini comes with Apple’s A17 Pro chip and support for Apple Intelligence. It’s also compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro and offers faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds.

It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699 $599 at Walmart\n\nThe 13-inch M4-powered MacBook Air is available at Amazon and Best Buy with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage starting at just $849 ($150 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low. The latest Air is faster than its predecessor thanks to the addition of Apple’s newer M4 chip, and now offers double the base RAM at 16GB. It also features a sharper 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam and supports two external displays with the lid open, making it even better for multitasking. Read our review.\nIf you prefer the 15-inch MacBook Air, the entry-level configuration with the M4 chip, a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is down to its all-time low of $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The larger Air is identical to its smaller sibling, only it features a better six-speaker sound system and comes with the option of either a 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or a 70W USB‑C Power Adapter.\niMac with M4 (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU)\nThe latest version of Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer features an M4 chip and support for Apple Intelligence. Unlike its predecessor, the base model now offers 16GB RAM by default, along with a new 12-megapixel webcam. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299 $1149 at Amazon\n $1299 $1149 at Best Buy\n $1299 at Apple\n\nThe best Apple Watch deals\nApple Watch Series 10 (GPS)\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 has a larger, wide-angle OLED display with up to 30 percent more screen area. It’s thinner and lighter than its predecessors, yet it charges faster and features the same fitness and wellness features. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $279 at Amazon (42mm)\n $399 $279 at Walmart (42mm)\n $429 $309 at Amazon (46mm)\n\nYou can buy the latest 40mm, GPS-enabled Apple Watch SE at Amazon and Walmart for $169, which is $20 shy of its best price to date. Apple’s entry-level wearable is great for tracking the essentials, including your heart rate and sleep quality, and offers fall/crash detection, Apple Pay, and other conveniences. While it lacks the Series 10’s temperature sensor, EKG, and depth tracking, the SE still delivers excellent value if you don’t need advanced health features. It will also support the next iteration of watchOS, watchOS 26, when it arrives in the fall with its new wrist flick gesture and AI-powered “Workout Buddy.” Read our review.\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm. It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s new S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s new double tap feature.

Apple’s premium stylus packs in advanced creative features missing from the entry-level USB-C model, including pressure sensitivity and a “Barrel Roll” gyroscope, which lets you rotate the stylus as you draw to quickly adjust the angle of your digital pen or brush. It also comes with wireless charging, Find My support, and squeeze gestures that let you control smart home devices. That being said, it’s only compatible with the latest iPad Pro, iPad Mini, and M2 or M3 iPad Air models.\nThe Apple Pencil (USB-C) is available at Amazon for just $59 ($20 off). That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen on the comfortable Apple stylus, which can magnetically attach to the side of most iPad models from within the past three years or so. It also offers tilt sensitivity, though it lacks the Apple Pencil Pro’s support for pressure sensitivity and wireless charging.\nBeats Pill (2024)\nThe 2024 Beats Pill offers improved sound, USB-C, and native support for Find My and voice assistants on both iOS and Android. It also bests the previous model with double the battery life (24 hours) and IP67 water resistance.

The Qi2-certified charger can deliver up to 15W of power to compatible iPhone models while simultaneously charging a pair of AirPods and an Apple Watch. Its foldable, lightweight design also makes it convenient for travel or keeping your nightstand clutter-free.\nYou can buy the Anker MagGo Wireless Charger (Pad) at Amazon for $19.99 ($10 off), which matches the best-ever price on this accessory. Anker’s Qi2-certified charging pad can deliver up to 15W of power to MagSafe-compatible iPhones, including the newer iPhone 16 models. It also comes with a five-foot cable; however, you will still need to supply your own AC adapter unless you spring for the $23.99 $25.99 bundle.\nBelkin 3-in-1 Qi2 Wireless Charging Station\nBelkin’s 3-in-1 charging station is Qi2-certified and can supply up to 15W of power to compatible phones.

It came with the cloud wrist rest, which was admittedly the main reason I bought it over other keyboards. (I got a rainy day-themed mouse pad from a small stationery shop called Unicorn Eclipse to complete the look.) I also liked the tenkeyless layout; my previous keyboard had a number pad <em>and</em> two rows of programmable keys, and even though setting up macros was nice, it took up way too much space on my desk. Plus, I only ever used the number pad to input the PC shortcut for em dashes.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Logitech G713 wired mechanical keyboard and wristrest</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-07-at-1.24.32 PM.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"White keyboard with white wristrest.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G-Wired-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B092LK5NSN/ref=sr_1_1\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $139.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-keyboards/g713-tkl-mechanical-gaming-keyboard.html\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $139.99 at <strong>Logitech</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/logitech-g713-aurora-collection-tkl-wired-mechanical-tactile-switch-gaming-keyboard-for-pc-mac-with-palm-rest-included-white-mist/6511300.p?skuId=6511300\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $139.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I also got the matching <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Customizable-LIGHTSYNC-Lightspeed-Connectivity-Lightweight/dp/B08V1JWV82?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0703awD__693207__________________google.com\">Logitech G705 wireless gaming mouse</a>, which, again, I use wired.

We managed to find quite a few.\nHere they are, along with any comments that the folks who use them had to say.\nKallie Plagge, senior copy editor\nI have a Logitech G713 wired mechanical keyboard with GX red linear switches. It came with the cloud wrist rest, which was admittedly the main reason I bought it over other keyboards. (I got a rainy day-themed mouse pad from a small stationery shop called Unicorn Eclipse to complete the look.) I also liked the tenkeyless layout; my previous keyboard had a number pad and two rows of programmable keys, and even though setting up macros was nice, it took up way too much space on my desk. Plus, I only ever used the number pad to input the PC shortcut for em dashes.\nLogitech G713 wired mechanical keyboard and wristrest\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.99 $139.99 at Amazon\n $169.99 $139.99 at Logitech\n $169.99 $139.99 at Best Buy\n\nI also got the matching Logitech G705 wireless gaming mouse, which, again, I use wired.

I got the E series model, which creates a safe zone where you likely won’t be bitten.

The Solar Buddies version I use has a big handle, spongy applicator, and a roller dispenser that ensures even small hands have a good grip and don’t look like they’ve dunked themselves in frosting. You just have to fill them with your sunscreen of choice, giving some added flexibility around the brand and SPF (but please,&nbsp;<em>please</em>&nbsp;consider sticking with a factor of 50 plus).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the applicator screws tightly closed, it can also help prevent any explosions from occurring in your bag compared to the usual squeeze bottles.

We called the MTA the next day, and through some miracle, the wallet had been found, and we were able to drive over to the local bus depot and pick it up. But it occurred to me that if he had a tracker in his wallet, we might not have been as worried as to where it was. The next day, I ordered a Tile Slim for that wallet. I’ve actually been using Tile trackers for my own keys and wallet for a couple of years now (although they’ve thankfully only been needed to locate items misplaced in our home). So as nice as the folks at the MTA were — and they were really nice — hopefully, my partner’s new Tile Slim will ensure it’s our last visit there. —&nbsp;<em>Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Royal Kludge Foldable Mechanical Keyboard</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-at-2.35.05 PM.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Two keyboards next to a phone, one opened, one folded.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://rkgamingstore.com/products/f68-60-foldable-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard\"> <strike>$54.99</strike> $43.99 at <strong>Royal Kludge (with discount code HOT20)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/RK-ROYAL-KLUDGE-Foldable-Mechanical/dp/B0CNVZGT2Q?th=1\"> <strike>$54.99</strike> $43.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I can’t help but laugh every time I hear “Royal Kludge,” but this is truly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221320/the-best-folding-portable-bluetooth-keyboard-ive-tried-yet-is-a-royal-kludge\">the best folding Bluetooth keyboard I’ve used yet</a>&nbsp;— because it’s the only multi-device keyboard I’ve tried that doesn’t fall off my lap!

It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PGZHCXR/\">Anker combination extension cord / power strip</a>. It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB-A and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. —&nbsp;<em>Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Epicka universal travel adapter</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Epicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24699548/Screenshot_2023_06_02_at_4.04.53_PM.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Travel adaptor on power strip connected to phones and laptop.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B0B8SLNBDP/\"> <strike>$23.99</strike> $19.54 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Basically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B0B8SLNBDP/\">this one from Epicka</a>&nbsp;is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. —&nbsp;<em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islet switches</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">A fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards.

There are obviously lots of good speakers out there, but for me, the UE Wonderboom 4 is the perfect one. It’s only $100, it’s small but loud enough to work just about anywhere, its battery lasts all day and then some, it’s waterproof, and it floats.

I wish they’d bug off. They have me looking like I’m doing interpretive dancing to avoid being poked. Thankfully, a gadget that I got last year has made it so that I don’t need to be (as) protective of my exposed skin.\nThermacell makes rechargeable and refillable mosquito repellers. I got the E series model, which creates a safe zone where you likely won’t be bitten. It lasts a little over five hours per charge, meaning I get more than one use out of it before needing to charge it again. Just be sure not to use it in an environment where there isn’t proper ventilation; Thermacell notes that its ingredients shouldn’t be a concern for people or pets, but I don’t want too much insecticide around my loved ones — or my food. — Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor\nHoto 3.6V Electric Screwdriver Kit (Classic)\nHoto’s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house.

I’m glad I did, though, because it now sits alongside a handful of tools I use on an almost weekly basis. I wouldn’t suggest using it for real household projects that require some serious torque, but it’s incredibly handy for tightening the legs on my desk, assembling furniture, and making sure my bike seat isn’t going to come off mid-ride. It’s also equipped with a USB-C port for charging, a nifty LED light that lets you ditch the headlamp, and a case for housing the 25 steel bits. Oh, and it really does make for a great little gift.

The only issue that I’m starting to hit is battery life — after over three years of use, it’s not unexpected that I sometimes hit the 20 percent mark toward the end of the day. So I recently realized that I’m going to have to start carrying around a portable charger. At first, I was going to go with the 20,000mAh Anker Zolo Power Bank, which had gotten a good number of recommendations. But it weighs over 11 ounces and when I dropped it into my bag, it felt like I had added a small brick. That’s why I traded it in for the less powerful but much lighter Anker Nano Power Bank, which plugs into my phone’s USB-C slot like a small add-on peripheral. The Nano weighs only 3.5 ounces and supplies 5,000mAh of battery power — enough to keep me going to the end of the day. And it comes in several pale colors (I chose Ice Lake Blue), which means I can see it more easily in the dark reaches of my bag. — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\nHamilton Beach 3-in-one Egg Cooker\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $20.99 at Hamilton Beach\n $20.95 $19.99 at Amazon\n\nMy body composition has become about 70 percent egg in the blissful month since I bought this cooker. I never want to buy new countertop kitchen appliances, because almost every time I do, they end up dusty in the back of the cabinet, but I’m amazed by how useful this simple Hamilton Beach Egg Cooker is. I can prepare hard- or soft-boiled eggs to perfect consistency in minutes (with no cleanup!), and having it on hand has dramatically cut back on my bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich habit. So it’s good for my cholesterol and my bank account. — Kristen Radtke, creative director\nHydro Flask Standard Mouth Water Bottle (18 oz)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.95 $23.96 at Amazon\n\nThis is a sturdy stainless steel water bottle that keeps water cold as I sip it throughout my workday. What more could you ask for? I take it on trips, too, and while it’s got a few dents from some drops onto concrete, I don’t really care. If anything, the dents add some character and make it mine. — Jay Peters, news editor\nInstant Pot Duo Crisp\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.99 $149.99 at Amazon\n\nFor the past few years, the Instant Pot has been a staple in my kitchen. From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel. — Emma Roth, news writer\nBraun MultiQuick 5 Vario Hand Blender\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.95 $49.99 at Braun\n $69.95 $49.95 at Amazon\n\nHow often do you blend things? Is it never? Maybe the reason is that taking out, assembling, and cleaning up after a normal blender is just way too much work. Do you know how many sauces I’ve thickened since getting an immersion blender? This thing is small, quick to set up, and you can mostly clean it with just a blast under the faucet. You’re going to blend so many things. — Jacob Kastrenakes, executive editor\nGripstic bag sealer 12-pack\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $23.95 $18.95 at Amazon\n $23.95 at Gripstic\n\nIt’s kind of weird how much I like our Gripstics. Bag of chips open? Quick, grab a Gripstic. Kids vibing between two different cereals this week? A well-placed Gripstic will ensure they don’t get all squishy. Tiny package of chocolate chips you used for a recipe that is now kind of open in your cupboard for who knows how long? Just fold the top over, slide a Gripstic on it — the small blue one, thank you — and stop worrying so much.\nI don’t know about you or your family’s shopping and eating habits, but try as we might to shop on the outside walls of the grocery store, we inevitably come home with many products packaged in single-use plastic bags. That in and of itself is a frustration, only compounded by those same products going bad if they’re not stored properly. The Gripstics are a simple solution to this universal problem, and one that I’m certain has paid for itself many times over. — Christopher Grant, group publisher\nSolar Buddies sunscreen applicator\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $11.98 at Solar Buddies\n $15.98 $12.78 at Amazon\n\nAs a pasty redhead from a large ginger family, I relish every opportunity to nag about the importance of wearing sunscreen — especially when the summer heat is pounding and everyone starts getting their fleshy bits out. If you’re someone who avoids applying the stuff because it makes your hands feel gross, then allow me to remove that excuse for you: sunscreen applicators are a convenient and mess-free solution that can help you protect your skin without itching to wipe your greasy hands on clothes or sandy towels.\nThey’re great for applying sunscreen to your kids, too. The Solar Buddies version I use has a big handle, spongy applicator, and a roller dispenser that ensures even small hands have a good grip and don’t look like they’ve dunked themselves in frosting. You just have to fill them with your sunscreen of choice, giving some added flexibility around the brand and SPF (but please, please consider sticking with a factor of 50 plus).\nBecause the applicator screws tightly closed, it can also help prevent any explosions from occurring in your bag compared to the usual squeeze bottles. Nobody likes a sunscreen sandwich. — Jess Weatherbed, news writer\nMagpul DAKA Essential Wallet\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $16.95 at Magpul\n $16.95 $13.56 at Amazon\n\nI spent the better part of a decade trying to find the perfect slim minimalist wallet for carrying a handful of credit cards, debit cards, and IDs, along with a small stash of cash. The winner, which I’ve been carrying every day for close to eight years now, is Magpul’s DAKA Essential Wallet. It’s made from a reinforced polymer fabric with welded seams that make it impressively durable. It’s also got an anti-slip texture that I find adds extra grip so I can easily extract it from even a tight pocket. I ended up buying three so I had backups when it eventually wore out, but am still using the original with minimal wear and tear. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter\nToAuto DS90 Soldering Station\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $47.99 at ToAuto\n $54.99 $39.99 at Amazon\n $59.99 $46.99 at Walmart\n\nMy ToAuto soldering station spent a few years gathering dust, but I finally pulled it out of the closet when I started experimenting with game console repairs. It may not be a Hakko or a Weller, but for $55, it gets the job done. The station is perfect for a beginner like me, as it heats up to 842 degrees Fahrenheit, comes with numerous interchangeable soldering tips, has steel wool for cleaning, and features a handy rack to hold a spool of solder. So far, it’s helped me do things like solder an HDMI port onto a PS4 and install new batteries on old Game Boy games. I expect it’s going to come in handy for many future repairs, too. — Emma Roth, news writer\npaleblue AA USB-C Rechargeable Batteries\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $22.49 at paleblue (4-pack)\n $29.99 $22.49 at Amazon (4-pack)\n\nI used to buy AA batteries in bulk to keep on hand for when my Xbox controller would die in the middle of a game. (And because I have two kids.) I’d resisted my friends’ suggestions to buy rechargeable batteries, thinking back to the old ones my parents used to have, with a big, bulky charging box that took forever. But then one night I came across these $30 paleblue USB-C rechargeable batteries. They’re great. Just plug them into a USB-C source using the included wire whenever you need to juice them up. They last long enough so that I’m not constantly swapping them out. And I can charge all four at once. I have the four-pack but there’s also an eight-pack and a 12-pack, which might be even more handy. — Todd Haselton, deputy editor\nTile Slim\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $19.94 at Amazon\n $29.98 at Walmart\n\nMy partner and I were coming back from dinner with a friend the other night, and as the bus roared away, he suddenly realized his wallet was no longer in his back pocket. We called the MTA the next day, and through some miracle, the wallet had been found, and we were able to drive over to the local bus depot and pick it up. But it occurred to me that if he had a tracker in his wallet, we might not have been as worried as to where it was. The next day, I ordered a Tile Slim for that wallet. I’ve actually been using Tile trackers for my own keys and wallet for a couple of years now (although they’ve thankfully only been needed to locate items misplaced in our home). So as nice as the folks at the MTA were — and they were really nice — hopefully, my partner’s new Tile Slim will ensure it’s our last visit there. — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\nRoyal Kludge Foldable Mechanical Keyboard\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 $43.99 at Royal Kludge (with discount code HOT20)\n $54.99 $43.99 at Amazon\n\nI can’t help but laugh every time I hear “Royal Kludge,” but this is truly the best folding Bluetooth keyboard I’ve used yet — because it’s the only multi-device keyboard I’ve tried that doesn’t fall off my lap! It’s also a mechanical keyboard with swappable keycaps, but that’s just the cherry on top. For me, the important bits are that it’s easy to type on, I can swap between multiple Bluetooth devices instead of re-pairing, I can plug it in with USB-C whenever Bluetooth won’t work, and it spans both my legs while folding vertically rather than horizontally, so it doesn’t just fall into the gap between my legs like so many rivals do. There really aren’t a lot of multi-device wired / wireless hybrid keyboards out there with USB-C ports. This one’s chunkier than the competition, but it’s a great deal. — Sean Hollister, senior editor\nYnesoer automatic soap dispenser\nA hands-free soap dispenser with a built-in sensor.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $18.5 at Amazon\n\nAfter realizing we’re not a family who likes to get their hands dirty while cooking (we leave that part to mixers and blenders), an automatic soap dispenser has become one of the most-used devices in our kitchen. We opted for a cheap $25 option from Amazon that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple of months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier $80 versions wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. We find we use less soap now that it’s always perfectly portioned out, and buying refills in bulk is much cheaper. There’s now one in every bathroom in our home. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nGouevn soil moisture meter\nGouevn’s cheap meter can quickly test the soil moisture for both indoor and outdoor plants.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $7.97 $6.76 at Amazon\n\nFungus gnats love overwatered soil, so once you’ve gotten rid of them, you’ve got to be careful and diligent about your watering schedule. For that, I got myself a Gouevn soil moisture meter to teach myself how to properly water my plants. I’ve properly vanquished my fungus gnat issue, but with these two tools, I’m always prepared in case there’s ever another infestation. – Victoria Song, senior reviewer\nMicroplane Premium Classic Series Lemon Zester\nA versatile kitchen tool that combines effortless grating and zesting.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $17.95 $14.85 at Amazon\n\nI never realized how much joy I could get from a grater until my partner and I picked up a Microplane last year. Whether I’m zesting lemons or creating big, pillowy clouds of grated parmesan for my pasta, the Microplane is an absolute pleasure to use. We still keep a big, blunt box grater around for the occasional vegetable, but the Microplane’s sharper blades are better for absolutely everything else.\nIt’s not just us, either — we’ve since gifted this twice, to rave reviews. And if you know me in real life, then I’m afraid it’s only a matter of time before a Microplane comes your way, too. — Dominic Preston, news editor\nRavensburger Starter-Set GraviTrax\nAn interactive track system allows you to design and build your own racetracks and experiment with gravity, magnetism, and kinetics.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $48.99 at Amazon\n\nWhen screen time is over, there’s no building toy, not even Lego, that holds my kid’s attention better than GraviTrax. It lets you build complicated marble runs using myriad components, including ramps, risers, bridges, switches, and launchers — and that’s just the starter set. There are several expansions that add motorized components that can keep marbles rolling indefinitely if assembled correctly, and it’s one of those toys that adults will enjoy just as much as kids do. For younger kids, there’s also now a GraviTrax Junior line with simpler components and larger marbles. – Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nAnker 321 Power Strip\nThis all-in-one 20W power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and one USB-C port.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $15.99 at Amazon\n\nNobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.\nOlder buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this Anker combination extension cord / power strip. It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB-A and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.\nThe three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.\nIf you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. — Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor\nEpicka universal travel adapter\nEpicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $23.99 $19.54 at Amazon\n\nIn my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.\nBasically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.\nThe only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in most countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer\nKailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islet switches\nA fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards. Islets are smooth and quiet, with a long spring that gives them a top-heavy, almost tactile force curve. They’re 3-pin switches, so they work with most hot-swappable mechanical keyboards that take 3- or 5-pin switches.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $56.99 at Amazon (90-piece)\n\nThese are my current favorite switches. The Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islets are nearly identical to the fantastic switches in the HHKB Studio, just much less expensive. The Islets are silent linear switches, with an extra-long spring, so the actuation force curve is strongest right at the beginning and then smooth the rest of the way, giving them an almost Topre-like tactile sensation. (Pitchforks down; I said almost.) They’re an instant upgrade for any hot-swappable keyboard that takes Cherry MX-compatible switches, and I’ve been using them as my daily drivers for a while. There’s also a tactile version, which I don’t like as much. Sorry to the Kailh Whales. — Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nNinja Fit single-serve blender\nSimple-to-use 700-watt blender that includes two 16-ounce cups and two spout lids.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69 $59.99 at Amazon\n $69.99 $59.99 at Target\n\nMy wife and I bought this small blender to make ourselves smoothies and protein shakes. It’s now used to make purees for our baby. C’est la vie. — Antonio G.

I say “nearly” because apparently the exposed Joy-Con 2 pins rub against the controller a bit, which may worry some.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.99 $49.99 at Walmart\n $79.99 $63.99 at Amazon\n $79.99 at Gamesir\n\nAnker 25,000mAh Laptop Power Bank\nWhile its 100W top charging speed is overkill for the Switch 2, this 25,000mAh battery contains multiple recharges for the console, as well as some of your other gadgets.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $134.99 $94.99 at Amazon\n $134.99 $94.99 at Anker (code WSPDV2LFUIUK) \n\namFilm OneTouch two-pack of glossy screen protectors\nYou really should protect your Switch 2’s screen. These glossy glass covers are easy to install, and let the full glow of the screen shine through.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $15.99 $8.48 at Amazon\n\namFilm OneTouch two-pack of matte screen protectors\nWhile equally protective as glossy protectors, these anti-glare matte covers tone down reflections, but in doing so, they slightly tone down how vibrant colors appear.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $15.99 $12.34 at Amazon\n\nSplatoon 3\nSplatoon 3 is one of a handful of original Switch games to get a free update that drastically enhances visual quality as well as frame rate. It’s the way the game was always meant to be experienced.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $39.99 at Best Buy (digital)\n $49.95 $39.99 at Walmart (physical)\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey\n2017’s Super Mario Odyssey is timeless, even more so with the Switch 2 update that makes the game run at higher resolution with HDR enabled. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $39.99 at Best Buy (digital)\n $59.99 $39.99 at Walmart (physical)\n\nUpdate, July 11th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability, and to provide a link for readers to our coverage of Prime Day day four.","summary":"The Nintendo Switch 2 is not discounted for Prime Day. Just getting that out of the way. The fastest-selling console ever came out on June 5th, and only just hit Amazon’s storefront for reservation a couple of days ago. Nevertheless, I thought it’d be fun to share some Prime Day deals I found on Switch [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/?p=704317","isoDate":"2025-07-11T10:24:09.000Z"}],"link":"https://www.theverge.com","feedUrl":"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml","title":"The Verge","lastBuildDate":"2025-07-11T11:38:30+00:00"}
