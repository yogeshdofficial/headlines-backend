A pool party, a park day, a golf outing, a hang on the back patio — it’s all better with music! There are obviously lots of good speakers out there, but for me, the UE Wonderboom 4 is the perfect one. It’s only $100, it’s small but loud enough to work just about anywhere, its battery lasts all day and then some, it’s waterproof, and it floats.

Thankfully, a gadget that I got last year has made it so that I don’t need to be (as) protective of my exposed skin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thermacell makes rechargeable and refillable mosquito repellers. I got the E series model, which creates a safe zone where you likely won’t be bitten. It lasts a little over five hours per charge, meaning I get more than one use out of it before needing to charge it again. Just be sure not to use it in an environment where there isn’t proper ventilation; Thermacell notes that its ingredients shouldn’t be a concern for people or pets, but I don’t want too much insecticide around my loved ones — or my food. <em>— Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Hoto 3.6V Electric Screwdriver Kit (Classic)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Hoto’s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house.

I’m glad I did, though, because it now sits alongside a handful of tools I use on an almost weekly basis. I wouldn’t suggest using it for&nbsp;<em>real&nbsp;</em>household projects that require some serious torque, but it’s incredibly handy for tightening the legs on my desk, assembling furniture, and making sure my bike seat isn’t going to come off mid-ride. It’s also equipped with a USB-C port for charging, a nifty LED light that lets you ditch the headlamp, and a case for housing the 25 steel bits. Oh, and it really does make for a great little gift.

The only issue that I’m starting to hit is battery life — after over three years of use, it’s not unexpected that I sometimes hit the 20 percent mark toward the end of the day. So I recently realized that I’m going to have to start carrying around a portable charger. At first, I was going to go with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ9LH53B?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0702awD__657469__________________google.com\">20,000mAh Anker Zolo Power Bank</a>, which had gotten a good number of recommendations.

The Nano weighs only 3.5 ounces and supplies 5,000mAh of battery power — enough to keep me going to the end of the day.

From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat.

If you’re someone who avoids applying the stuff because it makes your hands feel gross, then allow me to remove that excuse for you: sunscreen applicators are a convenient and mess-free solution that can help you protect your skin without itching to wipe your greasy hands on clothes or sandy towels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They’re great for applying sunscreen to your kids, too. The Solar Buddies version I use has a big handle, spongy applicator, and a roller dispenser that ensures even small hands have a good grip and don’t look like they’ve dunked themselves in frosting. You just have to fill them with your sunscreen of choice, giving some added flexibility around the brand and SPF (but please,&nbsp;<em>please</em>&nbsp;consider sticking with a factor of 50 plus).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because the applicator screws tightly closed, it can also help prevent any explosions from occurring in your bag compared to the usual squeeze bottles.

We called the MTA the next day, and through some miracle, the wallet had been found, and we were able to drive over to the local bus depot and pick it up. But it occurred to me that if he had a tracker in his wallet, we might not have been as worried as to where it was. The next day, I ordered a Tile Slim for that wallet. I’ve actually been using Tile trackers for my own keys and wallet for a couple of years now (although they’ve thankfully only been needed to locate items misplaced in our home). So as nice as the folks at the MTA were — and they were really nice — hopefully, my partner’s new Tile Slim will ensure it’s our last visit there. —&nbsp;<em>Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Royal Kludge Foldable Mechanical Keyboard</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-29-at-2.35.05 PM.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Two keyboards next to a phone, one opened, one folded.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://rkgamingstore.com/products/f68-60-foldable-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard\"> <strike>$54.99</strike> $43.99 at <strong>Royal Kludge (with discount code HOT20)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/RK-ROYAL-KLUDGE-Foldable-Mechanical/dp/B0CNVZGT2Q?th=1\"> <strike>$54.99</strike> $43.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I can’t help but laugh every time I hear “Royal Kludge,” but this is truly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221320/the-best-folding-portable-bluetooth-keyboard-ive-tried-yet-is-a-royal-kludge\">the best folding Bluetooth keyboard I’ve used yet</a>&nbsp;— because it’s the only multi-device keyboard I’ve tried that doesn’t fall off my lap!

It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PGZHCXR/\">Anker combination extension cord / power strip</a>. It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB-A and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. —&nbsp;<em>Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Epicka universal travel adapter</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Epicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24699548/Screenshot_2023_06_02_at_4.04.53_PM.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Travel adaptor on power strip connected to phones and laptop.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B0B8SLNBDP/\"> <strike>$23.99</strike> $19.54 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Basically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B0B8SLNBDP/\">this one from Epicka</a> is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. —&nbsp;<em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islet switches</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">A fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards.

So, we thought we’d list some in case you read about them in the past and thought, “Well, that sort of sounds good, but it’s a bit pricey,” or “that’s pretty cheap, but maybe I’ll wait until the price goes down even more.”\nHere are some of The Verge staff’s most-liked gear that’s now on sale during Prime Day.\nUltimate Ears Wonderboom 4\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $66.49 at Amazon\n $99.99 $69.99 at Best Buy\n\nI try to bring a Bluetooth speaker everywhere with me when the weather’s good. A pool party, a park day, a golf outing, a hang on the back patio — it’s all better with music! There are obviously lots of good speakers out there, but for me, the UE Wonderboom 4 is the perfect one. It’s only $100, it’s small but loud enough to work just about anywhere, its battery lasts all day and then some, it’s waterproof, and it floats. (All the colors look nice, by the way, but… get the blue one.) There are fancier speakers with more features, and the $200 Megaboom does sound a lot better, but I keep a Wonderboom in my trunk, and it has made me the party hero more times than I can count. — David Pierce, editor-at-large\nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $34.99 $17.68 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Thermacell\n $29.99 $17.68 at Walmart\n\nMy biggest deterrent to spending some time outside are bugs, mosquitos specifically. I wish they’d bug off. They have me looking like I’m doing interpretive dancing to avoid being poked. Thankfully, a gadget that I got last year has made it so that I don’t need to be (as) protective of my exposed skin.\nThermacell makes rechargeable and refillable mosquito repellers. I got the E series model, which creates a safe zone where you likely won’t be bitten. It lasts a little over five hours per charge, meaning I get more than one use out of it before needing to charge it again. Just be sure not to use it in an environment where there isn’t proper ventilation; Thermacell notes that its ingredients shouldn’t be a concern for people or pets, but I don’t want too much insecticide around my loved ones — or my food. — Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor\nHoto 3.6V Electric Screwdriver Kit (Classic)\nHoto’s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house. In addition to a USB-C port, the screwdriver comes with a magnetic case and 25 steel bits.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $39.99 at Amazon\n $59.99 $39.99 at Walmart\n\nI picked up Hoto’s electric screwdriver because my former boss at The Verge, Dan Seifert, would often pitch it around gift guide season. I’m glad I did, though, because it now sits alongside a handful of tools I use on an almost weekly basis. I wouldn’t suggest using it for real household projects that require some serious torque, but it’s incredibly handy for tightening the legs on my desk, assembling furniture, and making sure my bike seat isn’t going to come off mid-ride. It’s also equipped with a USB-C port for charging, a nifty LED light that lets you ditch the headlamp, and a case for housing the 25 steel bits. Oh, and it really does make for a great little gift. I guess Dan was right. — Brandon Widder, senior commerce editor\nAnker Nano Power Bank\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $19.99 at Amazon (USB-C)\n $36.43 $17.99 at Walmart (Lightning)\n\nI have a tendency to hold on to my phones as long as they work reasonably well, and although I must admit I’ve been tempted by the Pixel 9A, I will probably still be using my Pixel 6 for a bit longer. The only issue that I’m starting to hit is battery life — after over three years of use, it’s not unexpected that I sometimes hit the 20 percent mark toward the end of the day. So I recently realized that I’m going to have to start carrying around a portable charger. At first, I was going to go with the 20,000mAh Anker Zolo Power Bank, which had gotten a good number of recommendations. But it weighs over 11 ounces and when I dropped it into my bag, it felt like I had added a small brick. That’s why I traded it in for the less powerful but much lighter Anker Nano Power Bank, which plugs into my phone’s USB-C slot like a small add-on peripheral. The Nano weighs only 3.5 ounces and supplies 5,000mAh of battery power — enough to keep me going to the end of the day. And it comes in several pale colors (I chose Ice Lake Blue), which means I can see it more easily in the dark reaches of my bag. — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\nHamilton Beach 3-in-one Egg Cooker\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $20.99 at Hamilton Beach\n $20.95 $19.99 at Amazon\n\nMy body composition has become about 70 percent egg in the blissful month since I bought this cooker. I never want to buy new countertop kitchen appliances, because almost every time I do, they end up dusty in the back of the cabinet, but I’m amazed by how useful this simple Hamilton Beach Egg Cooker is. I can prepare hard- or soft-boiled eggs to perfect consistency in minutes (with no cleanup!), and having it on hand has dramatically cut back on my bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich habit. So it’s good for my cholesterol and my bank account. — Kristen Radtke, creative director\nHydro Flask Standard Mouth Water Bottle (18 oz)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.95 $23.96 at Amazon\n\nThis is a sturdy stainless steel water bottle that keeps water cold as I sip it throughout my workday. What more could you ask for? I take it on trips, too, and while it’s got a few dents from some drops onto concrete, I don’t really care. If anything, the dents add some character and make it mine. — Jay Peters, news editor\nInstant Pot Duo Crisp\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.99 $149.99 at Amazon\n\nFor the past few years, the Instant Pot has been a staple in my kitchen. From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel. — Emma Roth, news writer\nBraun MultiQuick 5 Vario Hand Blender\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.95 $49.99 at Braun\n $69.95 $49.95 at Amazon\n\nHow often do you blend things? Is it never? Maybe the reason is that taking out, assembling, and cleaning up after a normal blender is just way too much work. Do you know how many sauces I’ve thickened since getting an immersion blender? This thing is small, quick to set up, and you can mostly clean it with just a blast under the faucet. You’re going to blend so many things. — Jacob Kastrenakes, executive editor\nGripstic bag sealer 12-pack\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $23.95 $18.95 at Amazon\n $23.95 at Gripstic\n\nIt’s kind of weird how much I like our Gripstics. Bag of chips open? Quick, grab a Gripstic. Kids vibing between two different cereals this week? A well-placed Gripstic will ensure they don’t get all squishy. Tiny package of chocolate chips you used for a recipe that is now kind of open in your cupboard for who knows how long? Just fold the top over, slide a Gripstic on it — the small blue one, thank you — and stop worrying so much.\nI don’t know about you or your family’s shopping and eating habits, but try as we might to shop on the outside walls of the grocery store, we inevitably come home with many products packaged in single-use plastic bags. That in and of itself is a frustration, only compounded by those same products going bad if they’re not stored properly. The Gripstics are a simple solution to this universal problem, and one that I’m certain has paid for itself many times over. — Christopher Grant, group publisher\nSolar Buddies sunscreen applicator\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $11.98 at Solar Buddies\n $15.98 $12.78 at Amazon\n\nAs a pasty redhead from a large ginger family, I relish every opportunity to nag about the importance of wearing sunscreen — especially when the summer heat is pounding and everyone starts getting their fleshy bits out. If you’re someone who avoids applying the stuff because it makes your hands feel gross, then allow me to remove that excuse for you: sunscreen applicators are a convenient and mess-free solution that can help you protect your skin without itching to wipe your greasy hands on clothes or sandy towels.\nThey’re great for applying sunscreen to your kids, too. The Solar Buddies version I use has a big handle, spongy applicator, and a roller dispenser that ensures even small hands have a good grip and don’t look like they’ve dunked themselves in frosting. You just have to fill them with your sunscreen of choice, giving some added flexibility around the brand and SPF (but please, please consider sticking with a factor of 50 plus).\nBecause the applicator screws tightly closed, it can also help prevent any explosions from occurring in your bag compared to the usual squeeze bottles. Nobody likes a sunscreen sandwich. — Jess Weatherbed, news writer\nMagpul DAKA Essential Wallet\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $16.95 at Magpul\n $16.95 $13.56 at Amazon\n\nI spent the better part of a decade trying to find the perfect slim minimalist wallet for carrying a handful of credit cards, debit cards, and IDs, along with a small stash of cash. The winner, which I’ve been carrying every day for close to eight years now, is Magpul’s DAKA Essential Wallet. It’s made from a reinforced polymer fabric with welded seams that make it impressively durable. It’s also got an anti-slip texture that I find adds extra grip so I can easily extract it from even a tight pocket. I ended up buying three so I had backups when it eventually wore out, but am still using the original with minimal wear and tear. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter\nToAuto DS90 Soldering Station\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $47.99 at ToAuto\n $54.99 $39.99 at Amazon\n $59.99 $46.99 at Walmart\n\nMy ToAuto soldering station spent a few years gathering dust, but I finally pulled it out of the closet when I started experimenting with game console repairs. It may not be a Hakko or a Weller, but for $55, it gets the job done. The station is perfect for a beginner like me, as it heats up to 842 degrees Fahrenheit, comes with numerous interchangeable soldering tips, has steel wool for cleaning, and features a handy rack to hold a spool of solder. So far, it’s helped me do things like solder an HDMI port onto a PS4 and install new batteries on old Game Boy games. I expect it’s going to come in handy for many future repairs, too. — Emma Roth, news writer\npaleblue AA USB-C Rechargeable Batteries\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $22.49 at paleblue (4-pack)\n $29.99 $22.49 at Amazon (4-pack)\n\nI used to buy AA batteries in bulk to keep on hand for when my Xbox controller would die in the middle of a game. (And because I have two kids.) I’d resisted my friends’ suggestions to buy rechargeable batteries, thinking back to the old ones my parents used to have, with a big, bulky charging box that took forever. But then one night I came across these $30 paleblue USB-C rechargeable batteries. They’re great. Just plug them into a USB-C source using the included wire whenever you need to juice them up. They last long enough so that I’m not constantly swapping them out. And I can charge all four at once. I have the four-pack but there’s also an eight-pack and a 12-pack, which might be even more handy. — Todd Haselton, deputy editor\nTile Slim\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $19.99 at Amazon\n $29.98 at Walmart\n\nMy partner and I were coming back from dinner with a friend the other night, and as the bus roared away, he suddenly realized his wallet was no longer in his back pocket. We called the MTA the next day, and through some miracle, the wallet had been found, and we were able to drive over to the local bus depot and pick it up. But it occurred to me that if he had a tracker in his wallet, we might not have been as worried as to where it was. The next day, I ordered a Tile Slim for that wallet. I’ve actually been using Tile trackers for my own keys and wallet for a couple of years now (although they’ve thankfully only been needed to locate items misplaced in our home). So as nice as the folks at the MTA were — and they were really nice — hopefully, my partner’s new Tile Slim will ensure it’s our last visit there. — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\nRoyal Kludge Foldable Mechanical Keyboard\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 $43.99 at Royal Kludge (with discount code HOT20)\n $54.99 $43.99 at Amazon\n\nI can’t help but laugh every time I hear “Royal Kludge,” but this is truly the best folding Bluetooth keyboard I’ve used yet — because it’s the only multi-device keyboard I’ve tried that doesn’t fall off my lap! It’s also a mechanical keyboard with swappable keycaps, but that’s just the cherry on top. For me, the important bits are that it’s easy to type on, I can swap between multiple Bluetooth devices instead of re-pairing, I can plug it in with USB-C whenever Bluetooth won’t work, and it spans both my legs while folding vertically rather than horizontally, so it doesn’t just fall into the gap between my legs like so many rivals do. There really aren’t a lot of multi-device wired / wireless hybrid keyboards out there with USB-C ports. This one’s chunkier than the competition, but it’s a great deal. — Sean Hollister, senior editor\nYnesoer automatic soap dispenser\nA hands-free soap dispenser with a built-in sensor.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $18.5 at Amazon\n\nAfter realizing we’re not a family who likes to get their hands dirty while cooking (we leave that part to mixers and blenders), an automatic soap dispenser has become one of the most-used devices in our kitchen. We opted for a cheap $25 option from Amazon that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple of months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier $80 versions wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. We find we use less soap now that it’s always perfectly portioned out, and buying refills in bulk is much cheaper. There’s now one in every bathroom in our home. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nGouevn soil moisture meter\nGouevn’s cheap meter can quickly test the soil moisture for both indoor and outdoor plants.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $7.97 $6.76 at Amazon\n\nFungus gnats love overwatered soil, so once you’ve gotten rid of them, you’ve got to be careful and diligent about your watering schedule. For that, I got myself a Gouevn soil moisture meter to teach myself how to properly water my plants. I’ve properly vanquished my fungus gnat issue, but with these two tools, I’m always prepared in case there’s ever another infestation. – Victoria Song, senior reviewer\nMicroplane Premium Classic Series Lemon Zester\nA versatile kitchen tool that combines effortless grating and zesting.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $17.95 $14.85 at Amazon\n\nI never realized how much joy I could get from a grater until my partner and I picked up a Microplane last year. Whether I’m zesting lemons or creating big, pillowy clouds of grated parmesan for my pasta, the Microplane is an absolute pleasure to use. We still keep a big, blunt box grater around for the occasional vegetable, but the Microplane’s sharper blades are better for absolutely everything else.\nIt’s not just us, either — we’ve since gifted this twice, to rave reviews. And if you know me in real life, then I’m afraid it’s only a matter of time before a Microplane comes your way, too. — Dominic Preston, news editor\nRavensburger Starter-Set GraviTrax\nAn interactive track system allows you to design and build your own racetracks and experiment with gravity, magnetism, and kinetics.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $48.99 at Amazon\n\nWhen screen time is over, there’s no building toy, not even Lego, that holds my kid’s attention better than GraviTrax. It lets you build complicated marble runs using myriad components, including ramps, risers, bridges, switches, and launchers — and that’s just the starter set. There are several expansions that add motorized components that can keep marbles rolling indefinitely if assembled correctly, and it’s one of those toys that adults will enjoy just as much as kids do. For younger kids, there’s also now a GraviTrax Junior line with simpler components and larger marbles. – Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nAnker 321 Power Strip\nThis all-in-one 20W power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and one USB-C port.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $15.99 at Amazon\n\nNobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.\nOlder buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this Anker combination extension cord / power strip. It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB-A and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.\nThe three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.\nIf you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. — Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor\nEpicka universal travel adapter\nEpicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $23.99 $19.54 at Amazon\n\nIn my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.\nBasically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.\nThe only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in most countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer\nKailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islet switches\nA fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards. Islets are smooth and quiet, with a long spring that gives them a top-heavy, almost tactile force curve. They’re 3-pin switches, so they work with most hot-swappable mechanical keyboards that take 3- or 5-pin switches.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $56.99 at Amazon (90-piece)\n\nThese are my current favorite switches. The Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islets are nearly identical to the fantastic switches in the HHKB Studio, just much less expensive. The Islets are silent linear switches, with an extra-long spring, so the actuation force curve is strongest right at the beginning and then smooth the rest of the way, giving them an almost Topre-like tactile sensation. (Pitchforks down; I said almost.) They’re an instant upgrade for any hot-swappable keyboard that takes Cherry MX-compatible switches, and I’ve been using them as my daily drivers for a while. There’s also a tactile version, which I don’t like as much. Sorry to the Kailh Whales. — Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nNinja Fit single-serve blender\nSimple-to-use 700-watt blender that includes two 16-ounce cups and two spout lids.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69 $59.99 at Amazon\n $69.99 $59.99 at Target\n\nMy wife and I bought this small blender to make ourselves smoothies and protein shakes. It’s now used to make purees for our baby. C’est la vie. — Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer\nWüsthof 5-inch spreader knife\nHigh-end spreader knife smoothly cuts and spreads condiments, and has a serrated section for cutting through bread and vegetables.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25 $19 at Amazon\n $25 at Wüsthof\n\nSpreading knives are fantastic, especially if you make as many sandwiches as I do. The broad, flat blade is perfect for spreading peanut butter, cream cheese, or whatever, and the serrated edge is sharp enough for removing crusts and slicing bagels.\nThe one I used growing up was a Cutco, a relic of my dad’s brief, unsuccessful stint as a knife salesman. This is not that knife. That knife costs $94 today, which feels like a bit much — even if the one my parents have is still in great shape after 45 years — so I got this Wüsthof instead. The handle isn’t quite as comfortable, but it’s a quarter of the price, so I’ll live. — Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nUpdate, July 10th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability.","summary":"Every month, we like to ask our staff about their favorite stuff — whether it’s tech, kitchen tools, or camping gear.

An announcement that YouTube would be updating restrictions around “inauthentic” content under the YouTube Partner Program guidelines was interpreted by some to mean the platform was planning to demonetize a wider variety of videos, including those [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/?p=703772","isoDate":"2025-07-10T10:42:25.000Z"},{"title":"The best Prime Day 2025 deals you can still get","link":"https://www.theverge.com/tech/697599/amazon-prime-day-sale-best-tech-deals-2025-day-3","pubDate":"2025-07-10T10:29:16.000Z","author":"Sheena Vasani","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"⠀﻿\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257783_Prime_day_SDonaj_DAY-OF-ROUNDUP_4.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption>\n\t⠀﻿\t</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/689359/amazon-prime-day-tech-deals-guide-2025\">Amazon Prime Day</a> is usually a sprint — two hectic days of lightning deals, overflowing shopping carts, and enough browser tabs to crash a laptop. But this year, Amazon is treating it more like a marathon. Instead of wrapping things up after 48 hours, the retailer is giving <a href=\"http://amazon.com/amazonprime\">Prime members</a> two additional days to shop. We’re on day three now, yet the deals are just as good now as they were on day one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9WV1TPJ/\">Oura’s latest smart ring</a> is still $50 off, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-glare-free/dp/B0CFPJYX7P\">2024 Kindle Paperwhite</a> is holding steady at $124.99, and handy, budget-friendly gadgets like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHVNW1CN/\">Anker’s Nano travel adapter</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D637HK8Q/\">Tile Slim</a> are still available for their lowest prices to date. Plenty of high-end TVs and soundbars are discounted, too. And that’s just the tip of the proverbial, deal-laden iceberg.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To make things easier to navigate, we’ve organized all of our favorite Prime Day deals below based on category, so you can quickly find what you’re looking for. As always, we’ve only included gadgets <span>that <em>Verge </em>staffers have reviewed or personally tested, so you can shop with</span> confidence.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"prime-day-highlights\">Prime Day highlights</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It’s no Switch 2 deal, but Woot is selling the <strong>last-gen Switch OLED</strong> for the lowest price we’ve seen yet. The console with blue and red neon Joy-Con is $249.99 at <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-neon-blue-red-international-model\">Woot</a>, while the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes the game is $275.99 at the <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle-international-model\">retailer</a>, while supplies last. Note: these are international versions, which run just fine in the US, but they only have a 90-day Woot warranty instead of a 1-year manufacturer warranty.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple’s 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip</strong> has no business being a good value still in 2025. The laptop’s design is the most outdated thing about it, but its processor, along with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage make it a good entry-level Mac, especially at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/715596133\">Walmart</a>’s discounted $599.99 price (was $649.99).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A solid soundbar that can automatically rotate itself to fire sound upwards for Dolby Atmos content seems like it’d be expensive, but <strong>Vizio’s 5.1.2. Elevate SE system</strong> is actually just $299 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXR1G2RD\">Amazon</a> ($200 off).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>GameSir G8 Plus</strong> is one versatile mobile gaming controller, and it’s down to its lowest price of $49.99 at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/8698108756\">Walmart</a> (usually $79.99). This model can stretch to fit around phones and tablets as big as the iPad Mini. Alternatively, you can slot a Nintendo Switch into the grip, if you prefer its bulkier design to that of the Joy-Con. It can support the Switch 2 with a firmware update, but several folks on Reddit note that it touches the Joy-Con 2 pins as it squeezes to fit the console. Not sure how comfortable you are with that; it doesn’t seem to impact the usability of the console or its included controllers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep mosquitos at bay with <strong>Thermacell’s rechargeable repeller</strong>, which costs $17.68 (half off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PDNCMMN?th=1\">Amazon</a> for the version that lasts five hours per charge. It runs on cartridges, but a 12-hour one is included in the box.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s a good time to need new AirPods, because <strong>Apple’s AirPods Pro</strong> that come with a USB-C charging case are around $100 off for the first time at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C/5689919121\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382.p?\">Best Buy</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Genki’s small M.2 2230-sized enclosure called the <strong>SavePoint</strong> is $39.99 when you clip the on-page coupon at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-SavePoint-Enclosure-Compatible-Passthrough/dp/B0F5M5QTTJ/\">Amazon</a>. You can use it as a speedy USB-C SSD with any device, but it shines when connected to a Steam Deck because it has two USB-C ports (one for data, the other for power passthrough to keep the handheld charged). Here’s how to use it to <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/gaming/501039/steam-deck-how-to-install-windows-11-guide\">run Windows on your Steam Deck</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hoto’s rechargeable screwdriver</strong> is a both a <em>Verge</em>-favorite and a reader-favorite, and it’s discounted for Prime Day. It’s $36.09 (originally $79.99) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOTO-Electric-Screwdriver-Cordless-Mechanical/dp/B0BLMQ8BXB\">Amazon</a> for the 3.6V screwdriver, 25 steel bits, and a sleek carrying case to contain it all.

But this year, Amazon is treating it more like a marathon. Instead of wrapping things up after 48 hours, the retailer is giving Prime members two additional days to shop. We’re on day three now, yet the deals are just as good now as they were on day one.\nOura’s latest smart ring is still $50 off, the 2024 Kindle Paperwhite is holding steady at $124.99, and handy, budget-friendly gadgets like Anker’s Nano travel adapter and the Tile Slim are still available for their lowest prices to date. Plenty of high-end TVs and soundbars are discounted, too. And that’s just the tip of the proverbial, deal-laden iceberg.\nTo make things easier to navigate, we’ve organized all of our favorite Prime Day deals below based on category, so you can quickly find what you’re looking for. As always, we’ve only included gadgets that Verge staffers have reviewed or personally tested, so you can shop with confidence.\nPrime Day highlights\nIt’s no Switch 2 deal, but Woot is selling the last-gen Switch OLED for the lowest price we’ve seen yet. The console with blue and red neon Joy-Con is $249.99 at Woot, while the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes the game is $275.99 at the retailer, while supplies last. Note: these are international versions, which run just fine in the US, but they only have a 90-day Woot warranty instead of a 1-year manufacturer warranty.\nApple’s 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip has no business being a good value still in 2025. The laptop’s design is the most outdated thing about it, but its processor, along with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage make it a good entry-level Mac, especially at Walmart’s discounted $599.99 price (was $649.99).\nA solid soundbar that can automatically rotate itself to fire sound upwards for Dolby Atmos content seems like it’d be expensive, but Vizio’s 5.1.2. Elevate SE system is actually just $299 at Amazon ($200 off).\nThe GameSir G8 Plus is one versatile mobile gaming controller, and it’s down to its lowest price of $49.99 at Walmart (usually $79.99). This model can stretch to fit around phones and tablets as big as the iPad Mini. Alternatively, you can slot a Nintendo Switch into the grip, if you prefer its bulkier design to that of the Joy-Con. It can support the Switch 2 with a firmware update, but several folks on Reddit note that it touches the Joy-Con 2 pins as it squeezes to fit the console. Not sure how comfortable you are with that; it doesn’t seem to impact the usability of the console or its included controllers.\nKeep mosquitos at bay with Thermacell’s rechargeable repeller, which costs $17.68 (half off) at Amazon for the version that lasts five hours per charge. It runs on cartridges, but a 12-hour one is included in the box.\nIt’s a good time to need new AirPods, because Apple’s AirPods Pro that come with a USB-C charging case are around $100 off for the first time at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.\nGenki’s small M.2 2230-sized enclosure called the SavePoint is $39.99 when you clip the on-page coupon at Amazon. You can use it as a speedy USB-C SSD with any device, but it shines when connected to a Steam Deck because it has two USB-C ports (one for data, the other for power passthrough to keep the handheld charged). Here’s how to use it to run Windows on your Steam Deck.\nHoto’s rechargeable screwdriver is a both a Verge-favorite and a reader-favorite, and it’s discounted for Prime Day. It’s $36.09 (originally $79.99) at Amazon for the 3.6V screwdriver, 25 steel bits, and a sleek carrying case to contain it all. There’s an on-page coupon to save an extra 10 percent, too.\nSmart home deals\nAmazon Echo Spot\nThe newer Echo Spot is an excellent smart alarm clock with decent sound for its size and no camera. It features Amazon’s smart voice assistant for voice control and is worthy of a spot on your nightstand. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.99 $44.99 at Amazon\n $79.99 at Best Buy\n $79.99 at Target\n\n\nSwitchBot Smart Switch Button Pusher\nIf you’ve ever wished you had a robot that could push a button for you, that’s precisely what the SwitchBot Bot does. It’s simple, smart, and works on anything with a button. Stick it on the device you want to turn on or off, and you’re set. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $20.3 at Amazon (with coupon)\n $29.99 $20.99 at SwitchBot (with code SWPD33)\n\nFor the first time since Black Friday, a three-pack of Google’s shiny Nest WiFi Pro routers — all of which support Wi-Fi 6E — are down to $289.99 at Amazon. This kit typically sells for around $372. Read our review.\nFor $199.99, you can get a three-pack of TP-Link’s Deco XE75 routers at Amazon. Like Google’s Nest WiFi Pro, these tri-band routers support the 6GHz band. However, each XE75 sports a 2.5Gbps port (plus two other gigabit ethernet ports), while Google’s option tops out at 1Gbps and only has two gigabit ports per router.\nIf you’re looking for a high-end router that supports ludicrously fast wired connections, as well as great wireless connections, Eero’s Max 7 is one of the best. You can purchase a single router at Amazon right now for $419.99 (it had previously not sold for less than $449.99). Alternatively, you can grab a three-pack at Amazon for $1,189.99 (was $1,699.99). This model offers tri-band support and features two 10Gbps ethernet ports, as well as two 2.5Gbps ports, on each router.\nAmazon Echo Show 5 (third-gen)\nThe newest Echo Show 5 is just as small as its predecessor but features updated mics and a speaker system that delivers double the bass and clearer sound quality.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89.99 $59.99 at Amazon\n $89.99 at Best Buy\n $89.99 at Target\n\nAir quality is important, and it’s nice to have a reading that’s more local than what your phone gives you for your neighborhood. For a granular look at the air quality in your home, you can snag Amazon’s aptly titled Air Quality Monitor, which is currently matching its all-time low of $44.99 ($25 off) at Amazon for Prime Day. Read our review.\nMeross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener\nMeross makes a handy add-on that can transform a variety of garage door models into smart doors that you can open remotely. It works with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $49.99 $39.99 at Amazon\n\n\nAmazon Smart Thermostat\nDeveloped in partnership with Resideo, the Amazon Smart Thermostat allows you to control the temperature of your home through Alexa voice controls and remotely via an app. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.99 $51.99 at Amazon\n $79.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe battery-powered Google Nest Doorbell is down to $119 ($60 off) at Amazon, matching its lowest price to date, in the color of your choice. There are certain omissions you’ll encounter with the battery model versus the pricier option. For example, it lacks 4K video and 24/7 capture. If those don’t bother you, this is a solid option, especially in the design department. Read our review.\nPrime members can snag Govee’s slick RGBIC floor lamp for a mere $59.99, which matches its previous low. This thin, futuristic lamp is ideal for corners, as it can splash colors onto your walls, syncing with your music, or with a color combo that sets the vibes in the room.\nThe cost of the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium fluctuates nearly as much as the temperature each day, but it’s cheaper than ever during Prime Day. You can currently snag the smart thermostat, which includes a smart sensor and air quality monitor, for $209 (previously $249.99). Read our review.\nGoogle’s fourth-gen Nest Learning Thermostat is one of the best we’ve tested, and it’s marked down to $218 ($61 off) at Amazon. It comes with a temperature sensor you can place in a room that you want to monitor, and it’ll use that reading to decide whether to turn your system on or off. The thermostat learns your HVAC usage patterns over time, so it can automatically heat and cool your home based on your typical schedule. Read our review. \nThe Nest Thermostat E is a pared down version of the fourth-gen model, with a monochrome screen, but without support for additional sensors or learning your heating/cooling routine. Still, it’s a solid smart thermostat that’s currently on sale for $85.49 ($43 off) at Amazon, its lowest price of the year. Read our review.\nRing Floodlight Cam Wired Pro\nThe Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Pro delivers high-quality video with adjustable, accurate radar-powered motion detection, 2,000 lumens of light, and a good digital zoom. It offers smart alerts for people or motion and works with Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, and Ring’s excellent app.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $159.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n $249.99 at The Home Depot\n\n\nRing Battery Doorbell Plus\nThis is a great battery-powered buzzer with excellent video quality, a good head-to-toe view, and very speedy response times for a battery doorbell. It integrates well with Amazon Alexa and can record locally to a Ring Alarm Pro, but the battery only lasts about two months unless you turn on battery-saving features.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149.99 $79.99 at Amazon\n $149.99 at Best Buy\n $149.99 at Target\n\nBlink built its Mini 2 camera to be a great, inexpensive indoor or outdoor camera. By default, it’s an indoor cam, with HD video, color night video, and two-way audio support. It’s a good deal on Amazon right now, too, where you can grab it for $19.99 ($20 off). If you need an outdoor cam, you can grab it with a weather-resistant power adapter for just $10 more (normally $49.98).\nThanks to Prime Day, Amazon’s slick Echo Pop smart speaker is down to $21.99 (nearly 50 percent off). It’s available in four colors (black, grey, purple, and teal), and select designs of the Kids version — which comes with parental controls and six months of Amazon Kids Plus— are also discounted to $21.99.\nAmazon Echo Dot (fifth-gen)\nThe fifth-gen Echo Dot touts a temperature sensor, better sound, and faster response time than the prior model. It can also act as an extender for your Eero Wi-Fi system. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $49.99 $31.99 at Amazon\n $49.99 at Best Buy\n $49.99 at Target\n\n\nAmazon Smart Plug\nAmazon’s apt-titled Smart Plug doesn’t require a hub and lets you add Alexa functionality to any outlet, allowing you to control a range of devices with just your voice.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $24.99 $12.99 at Amazon\n $24.99 at Best Buy\n\nTP-Link’s Kasa smart home brand makes several Matter-ready Wi-Fi plugs, and a two-pack of them is currently available for just $19.99 ($20 off) at Amazon. You can control the plugs from within the Kasa app, or by giving voice commands via Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, or Samsung SmartThings.\nIf your smart home extends outside, TP-Link also has a two-outlet Tapo Matter outdoor smart plug, which has the same features as its indoor plugs and is on sale for $16.99 ($8 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The outlets are housed in an IP65 weather-resistant housing, and a pair of removable caps prevent water from getting in when nothing is connected.\nGE’s Cync Reveal HD Plus smart undercabinet light fixture is currently $30.37 ($10 off) at Amazon a 12-inch long light bar that can be screwed into the underside of a kitchen island or cabinet to provide illumination in hard-to-reach places.

The entry-level earbuds offer reliable performance and satisfactory sound — especially at this price — though they lack wireless charging, multipoint support, and some of the newer frills found on Samsung’s flagship earbuds. That said, they also come with a pair of silicone “wings” to help them stay firmly planted in place, which some considered a hallmark of prior models. Read our review.\nIf you’re an Apple user, there’s no better pair of starter buds than the open-style AirPods 4, which have fallen to a new low of $89 ($41 off) at Amazon and Walmart.

Read our review.\nSony’s newer WH-1000XM6 are our No. 1 pick for the best ANC headphones, but the prior model remains an excellent alternative at $248 ($150 off), their current price on Amazon. The WH-1000XM5 still offer top-tier noise cancellation and superb sound, along with a helpful transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth support, and other handy features.

The newer WF-C710N do, however, and they’ve reached a new low price of $78 ($41 off) at Amazon for Prime Day. What’s more, the budget-minded earbuds also borrow some tricks from Sony’s pricier earbuds, including improved noise cancellation and battery life, an automatic pause feature, and touch buttons that allow you to control playback without whipping out your phone.\nSony’s Float headphones are currently down to $78 ($52 off) at Amazon, which is significantly less than their previous low of $108.

They also block noise more effectively than previous Skullcandy offerings and come in an array of fun colors, including a chic leopard print.\nThe CMF Buds Pro 2 are available starting at $47 ($22 off) from Amazon and Nothing, matching their best price to date.

Black & Decker’s rechargeable Furbuster — now on sale at Amazon and Chewy for $79.99, its lowest price of the year — is a great handheld alternative that’s well-suited for picking up fur, dirt, and other unwanted debris, especially when you tack on the extra-long crevice tool or the included motorized pet brush.\nIf you’re looking for a more “innovative” way to eat cereal, the CrunchCup is on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $18.95 ($6 off).

Read our review.\nSony’s newer WH-1000XM6 are our No. 1 pick for the best ANC headphones, but the prior model remains an excellent alternative at $248 ($150 off), their current price on Amazon. The WH-1000XM5 still offer top-tier noise cancellation and superb sound, along with a helpful transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth support, and other handy features.

The newer WF-C710N do, however, and they’ve reached a new low price of $78 ($41 off) at Amazon for Prime Day. What’s more, the budget-minded earbuds also borrow some tricks from Sony’s pricier earbuds, including improved noise cancellation and battery life, an automatic pause feature, and touch buttons that allow you to control playback without whipping out your phone.\nSony’s Float headphones are currently down to $78 ($52 off) at Amazon, which is significantly less than their previous low of $108.

They’re basically a pair of low-end Bose earbuds in disguise — hell, they even use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose — which means they offer well-balanced sound, solid battery life, and a number of great features for the price. They also block noise more effectively than previous Skullcandy offerings and come in an array of fun colors, including a chic leopard print.\nThe CMF Buds Pro 2 are available starting at $47 ($22 off) from Amazon and Nothing, matching their best price to date. The inexpensive buds come loaded with features, including active noise cancellation, ChatGPT integration, and up to 6.5 hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled.
