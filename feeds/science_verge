Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind. Fortunately, the next iteration of watchOS will continue to support the same devices when it arrives in the fall, even if Apple is revamping its naming convention in a bid to standardize its operating system names.\nAll that being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $299 at Amazon\n $399 $299 at Walmart\n $399 at Best Buy\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 $359 at Amazon\n $429 $359 at Walmart\n $429 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($100 off), matching its best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $359 ($70 off) — which is the third-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at around $476 ($23 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $169 at Amazon\n $249 $189 at Walmart\n $249 at Best Buy\n\n\n2022 Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $199.99 at Amazon\n $279 $219 at Walmart\n $279 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022.

The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"

Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise.

Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24805959/DSCF2249_Enhanced_NR.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" title=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The WF-1000XM5 are smaller and more comfortable than their M4 predecessors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SUJOO3\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23803374/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review\">Read our&nbsp;full WF-1000XM5 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d26N53\">The best budget earbuds under $100</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Nothing Ear (a)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow.

They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.</p>\n\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/620706/powerbeats-pro-2-apple-heart-rate-gym-equipment\">can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment</a> when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.<br></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257536_Powerbeats_Pro_2_AKrales_0129.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro 2 have an ear-hook design for maximum stability.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orqrNZ\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/headphone-review/609473/powerbeats-pro-2-review-headphones-heart-rate-monitoring-wearables\">Read our full&nbsp;Powerbeats Pro 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"MzRNQU\">The best earbuds for iPhone owners</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24043027/DSCF9466.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro photographed on a reflective black surface.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Much better noise cancellation</li><li>Improved sound quality and clarity</li><li>Unrivaled hearing health features</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Unchanged design</li><li>Sound is better but not top tier</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\"> <strike>$249</strike> $199 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C/5689919121/\"> <strike>$249</strike> $199 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382.p?skuId=6447382\"> $249.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>6<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>For those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review\">second-gen AirPods Pro</a> bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair.

The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you.</p>\n\n<p>Where the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model.

If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KrjFep\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23281445/google-pixel-buds-pro-noise-canceling-earbuds-review\">Read our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dv7Dfx\">The best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Beats Studio Buds Plus</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24662267/DSCF0760_2.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of Beats’ translucent Studio Buds Plus earbuds.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Better sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds</li><li>Standout translucent case option</li><li>Improved voice call performance</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>ANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro</li><li>Doesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks</li><li>No wireless charging or in-ear detection</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZK2Z2TC\"> $169.95 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Beats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Earbuds-Black-Gold/3635657547/\"> $169.95 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/beats-studio-buds-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds-transparent/6501047.p\"> $169.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>6 hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Beats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24662272/DSCF0775_Enhanced_NR.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of Beats’ translucent Studio Buds Plus earbuds.\" title=\"A photo of Beats’ translucent Studio Buds Plus earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The translucent color option has a very ‘90s vibe.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.</p>\n\n<p>The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get <em>all</em> the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"N3Z6oA\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear\">Read our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ziSHXY\">The best earbuds for sound quality</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25311367/DSC_0448_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds in copper.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Fantastic sound quality</li><li>Improved day-to-day reliability</li><li>Auracast-enabled</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Too pricey for some</li><li>Noise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special</li><li>Long-term durability remains to be seen</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-MOMENTUM-Bluetooth-Crystal-Clear-Comfortable/dp/B0CTQ5YZYP/\"> <strike>$299.95</strike> $259.95 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1808815-REG/sennheiser_700367_sennheiser_momentum_true_wireless.html\"> <strike>$299.95</strike> $279.95 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/momentum-true-wireless-4/\"> <strike>$299.95</strike> $279.95 at <strong>Sennheiser</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>7.5 hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP54 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint: </strong>Yes / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to.

But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.</p>\n\n<p>On the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25623457/DSCF0059.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A hands-on photo of Apple’s AirPods 4 wireless earbuds.\" title=\"A hands-on photo of Apple’s AirPods 4 wireless earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>Overall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes&#8230; there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.</p>\n\n<p>The AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"PxCkgD\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review\">Read our full AirPods 4 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pTcGEr\">The best earbuds for voice calls on Android</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25664552/DSC_0886.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A hands-on photo of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro earbuds.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Terrific sound quality</li><li>Crisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode</li><li>Voice commands are simple and so useful</li><li>Good voice calls</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Uninspired design</li><li>Midtier noise cancellation performance</li><li>No true multipoint</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7/\"> $249.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-buds3-pro-wireless-earbud-headphones-silver/6585614.p\"> $249.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://howl.link/jmukqjuazc0uk\"> $249.99 at <strong>Samsung</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>6<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP57 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (S, M, L)</em></em></em></em></p>\n\n<p>Sony’s unconventional <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22933521/sony-linkbuds-earbuds-review-features-specs\">LinkBuds</a> were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors.

The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Sony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $248 at Amazon\n $299.99 $249 at Best Buy\n $299.99 $249.99 at Target\n\nBest noise-canceling: Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\nWith dynamic, rich sound and the best ANC available, the QC Ultra Earbuds are a terrific pick if you want to listen to your music in peace.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Walmart\n $299 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller, more comfortable design\nUpgrades to ANC and sound quality\nMuch clearer voice call performance\n\nGlossy texture can make them harder to remove from case\nSony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors\nPotential battery longevity concerns\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $248 at Amazon\n $299.99 $249 at Best Buy\n $299.99 $249.99 at Target\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100.\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStandout color and design\nVery compact carrying case\nGreat performer for the price\n\nLimited retail availability\nPlastic case can show scuffs\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $69 at Nothing\n $99 $89 at Amazon\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my full Nothing Ear (a) impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMost powerful ANC you’ll find in earbuds\nLively, rich sound\nStabilizer fins are easier to apply\n\nImmersive Audio drains battery\nWireless charging requires $49 case\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Walmart\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nBose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job of offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life, putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts.\nThe QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II in terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio.\nThat being said, it’s worth noting that Bose recently announced an updated version of the QC Ultra Earbuds, which, with the help of AI, supposedly offer improved call quality and enhanced adaptive ANC to help curb sudden spikes in noise. They’ll also retail for the same price as the current model and come with a wireless charging case when they launch later this summer, preventing you from having to pay extra for what has essentially become a table stakes feature at this point.\nRead our full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah! Wireless charging!\nAdds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audio\nSlimmer ear hook, smaller case\nAdds heart rate\nGreat sound\nNo price hike\n\nCase is still a chonker\nHeart rate is not that useful for iOS users\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 at Amazon\n $249 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nApple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMuch better noise cancellation\nImproved sound quality and clarity\nUnrivaled hearing health features\n\nUnchanged design\nSound is better but not top tier\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $199 at Amazon\n $249 $199 at Walmart\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nFor those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option.\nThe AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you.\nWhere the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem.\nIn the fall, Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health features for the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss.\nRead our original AirPods Pro (second-gen) review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n $249.99 at Samsung\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but I’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $206.14 at Amazon\n $229 $213.99 at Best Buy\n $229 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.95 $259.95 at Amazon\n $299.95 $279.95 at B&H Photo\n $299.95 $279.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 $119 at Amazon\n $129 $119 at Walmart\n $129.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n $249.99 at Samsung\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for me during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear me without issue, even when I’m answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge except where specified\nUpdate, July 3rd: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and flag Bose’s forthcoming model, the second-gen QC Ultra Earbuds.

Wallets are always exactly where they’re supposed to be, keys never go missing, and remotes never slip between the couch cushions. And then there’s the rest of us — the folks who can’t <em>ever</em> seem to find the thing that was <em>right</em> there a few seconds ago. For us, there are Bluetooth trackers.</p>\n\n<p>Bluetooth trackers have been around for a long time, and they all generally work the same way. You stick the tracker onto an object, pair it with your phone, and then, when you lose said object, you can go into an app and ring the tracker. But these days, Bluetooth trackers can do a lot more. Some have ultra-wideband chips that enable precision tracking, so you can find exactly where in a room your item is. Increasingly, trackers also tap into large networks — like Apple’s and Google’s — making it easier to locate lost items outside the home. Many will notify you if they detect you’ve left the device behind or come with QR codes that link to your contact information so people can easily return lost devices.</p>\n\n<p>These features are incredibly handy but also have the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22947917/airtags-privacy-security-stalking-solutions\">potential for misuse</a>. Take AirTags. When Apple launched the trackers, it hadn’t anticipated they’d be used to track people or stolen items — but <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/apple-airtags-causing-major-security-concerns-reports-stalking/story?id=96531871\">that’s exactly what happened</a>. It’s since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22927374/apple-airtag-safety-update-stalking\">beefed up</a> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/02/an-update-on-airtag-and-unwanted-tracking/\">its anti-stalking features</a>, and companies like Tile have also <a href=\"https://www.tile.com/en-us/blog/tile-introduces-scan-and-secure-feature-unwanted-tracking-safety\">followed suit</a>. Apple and Google have launched a standard that enables <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155630/apple-google-airtag-bluetooth-tracker-alert-standard\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155630/apple-google-airtag-bluetooth-tracker-alert-standard\">unwanted tracking alerts across both Android and iOS devices</a> — and major players like Tile, Samsung, and Chipolo are on board. But until this standard is up and running, it pays to be aware of each tracker’s current approach when you’re deciding the best option for you.</p>\n\n<p>As a consummate Loser of Things, I’ve tested my fair share of Bluetooth trackers on wallets, keys, and luggage. Here’s what I’d recommend if you, too, have a hard time finding things.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#zmtuOa\">The best tracker for iPhone users</a></li><li><a href=\"#lIWi5H\">The best Bluetooth tracker for Android users</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-airtag-and-tile-alternative\">The best AirTag and Tile alternative</a></li><li><a href=\"#2XTVy0\">The best AirTag alternatives for wallets</a></li><li><a href=\"#other-bluetooth-trackers-to-consider\">Other Bluetooth trackers to consider</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"zmtuOa\">The best tracker for iPhone users</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple AirTag</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Apple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with their ultra wideband technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app that can detect an AirTag’s location and notify you if one seems to be following you.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461382/vpavic_4547_20210421_0058.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"An AirTag in an Apple keychain accessory\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWXNS552\"> <strike>$29</strike> $22.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirTag-1-Pack/475634131\"> <strike>$29</strike> $22.99 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airtag-silver/6377581.p\"> <strike>$29</strike> $22.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p>When Apple launched AirTags in 2021, it really did shake up the category. That’s because AirTags are equipped with Apple’s Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip <em>and</em> tap into Apple’s vast Find My network. That’s a potent combo. And even though you can now get <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/icloud/find-my/\">third-party accessories that work with the Find My network</a> — including the Pebblebee trackers featured later in this guide — AirTags are still the best, thanks to UWB. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, UWB enables precision tracking while Find My compatibility expands range far, far beyond Bluetooth’s limitations. With precision tracking, all you have to do is open the Find My app, tap “Find,” and you should see an arrow pointing you in the exact direction you need to go to find your item. Using the Find My network also means that so long as there’s an Apple device nearby, a lost AirTag can ping its location to Apple’s iCloud servers without notifying the owners of those other devices. And there are over a billion Apple products out there.</p>\n\n<p>That accuracy is super convenient. My keys fell out of my pocket while running once, and I didn’t notice until my phone pinged me to say my keys were no longer with me. While I wasn’t able to use the precision tracking outdoors, I <em>could</em> see the last reported location in the Find My app. Twenty minutes had already passed, but I still was able to find my keys. I haven’t had that degree of success with any other item tracker.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461379/vpavic_4547_20210421_0038.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"An AirTag wedged into some planks of wood.\" title=\"An AirTag wedged into some planks of wood.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;AirTags come with UWB-powered precision tracking.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\" />\n<p>However, this accuracy is a double-edged sword. In 2022, I ran a test to see whether I could track a friend and my spouse (with their consent) in real time. And I could, to a disturbing degree. While Apple’s unwanted tracking prevention measures worked, there were also inherent flaws. (You can read about our testing in full <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22947917/airtags-privacy-security-stalking-solutions\">here</a>.) However, Apple has since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/10/22927374/apple-airtag-safety-update-stalking\">improved unwanted tracking alerts</a> by shortening the time before you’re notified an unknown AirTag is in your vicinity, making chimes louder, and creating <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832731/apple-android-app-airtag-search-tracker-detect-find-my\">a separate app</a> that lets Android users scan for unknown AirTags. Apple also now informs users during setup that unwanted tracking is a crime and that AirTags are “intended solely to track items that belong to you.”</p>\n\n<p>Apple has also added more ways to share AirTag locations with trusted people. iOS 17 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23751614/apple-airtag-find-my-sharing-ios-17-feature\">introduced AirTag sharing</a>, which means shared items won’t trigger unwanted tracking alerts. As of iOS 18.2, you can also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293654/apple-ios-18-2-share-airtag-locations\">share the location of a lost AirTag</a> with other people via a temporary link. So if an airline loses your luggage, you can send them a link that shows them an interactive map of your item’s last known location. (Apple is partnering with more than 15 airlines for this particular use case.)</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I really don’t like about AirTags is they aren’t truly $29. They’re $29 plus the cost of whatever accessory is needed to attach them to the item you want to track. For example, you’ll need a holder to attach it to your keys or luggage. Thankfully, there’s a robust third-party accessory market, so you don’t have to pay Apple’s prices if you don’t want to. The fact that you can easily replace the battery with a regular CR2032 coin cell battery helps take the sting out, too. I just did it for two of my AirTags, and it was much, <em>much</em> cheaper than having to buy two new ones.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SDsfpL\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety\">Read our original AirTags review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lIWi5H\">The best Bluetooth tracker for Android users</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Tile Pro</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Tile Pro is the company’s loudest Bluetooth tracker and has the widest range at 400 feet.

Functionally, the platform-agnostic trackers can do just about anything an AirTag can. Like AirTags, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags\">Tile devices can tap into a larger network</a> — in this case, the <a href=\"https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/204315768-Tile-Network\">Tile Network</a> and Amazon Sidewalk — to help you find your devices outside of your phone’s Bluetooth range. While this network isn’t as expansive as Apple’s or Google’s, Amazon Sidewalk’s coverage has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659191/amazon-sidewalk-network-coverage\">improved significantly</a>. In our April 2025 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/google/655319/google-find-my-device-smart-tag-network-one-year-later\">testing of Google’s Find Hub-compatible trackers</a> — including the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185612/motorola-moto-tag-android-find-my-device\">Moto Tag</a> — we found that Tile still did better at tracking items outside the home. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Tile still can&#8217;t do true real-time tracking, and it still doesn’t offer a tracker with UWB, so it lacks the AirTag’s precision tracking. The company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716870/tile-ultra-bluetooth-tracker-uwb-ar-early-2022\">announced</a> one back in 2021, but we’re still waiting, partly because Apple is <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/04.21.21%20Kirsten%20Daru%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Testimony%20Final.pdf\">effectively blocking UWB compatibility</a> for third parties in iOS and because <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/gadgets-tech/phones-accessories/tile-ultra-key-finder-release-date-what-happened-b2214979.html\">Tile’s priorities shifted</a> once it was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22797559/tile-bluetooth-tracker-location-gps-acquisition-life360\">acquired by Life360</a>. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-note-about-google-s-find-hub-network-1\">A note about Google’s Find Hub network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 2024, Google finally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24124174/android-find-my-device-network-offline-tracker-tag-chipolo-pebblebee\">launched its Find My Device network</a>, which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665754/google-uwb-find-hub-rebrand-find-my-device-moto-tag\">was recently renamed Find Hub</a>.&nbsp;It works similarly to Apple’s Find My network: you’ll be able to share trackers with family members, and there are also unwanted tracking alerts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Initially, the network lagged behind Apple’s, but it’s starting to catch up. After <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/google/655319/google-find-my-device-smart-tag-network-one-year-later\">several weeks of testing Find Hub-compatible trackers</a> — specifically the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185612/motorola-moto-tag-android-find-my-device\">Moto Tag</a> — in April 2025, we found the network’s improved significantly over the past year, more so in busy areas. Still, it’s clear Google prioritized privacy over precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That balance may shift, though. In May 2025, Google <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665754/google-uwb-find-hub-rebrand-find-my-device-moto-tag\">added UWB support</a>&nbsp;for more accurate tracking with Motorola’s&nbsp;Moto Tag&nbsp;and, eventually, other compatible phones and trackers. Google also plans to roll out satellite connectivity later later in 2025, with the ability to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665776/google-adds-tracker-sharing-with-airlines\">share tracker locations with airline staff</a>&nbsp;arriving in early 2026.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>That said, Life360’s acquisition has brought some meaningful upgrades. Pressing a Tile button three times now sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts through Life360. You can also add others to your Circle so they can view and ring nearby Tiles on a shared Life360 map.&nbsp;More recently, Tile trackers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/675912/tile-bluetooth-trackers-fully-integrated-with-life360-app\">have become fully integrated</a> into Life360, letting users manage their trackers directly within the Life360 app. This merger unlocked a few premium features for free, including push alerts for forgotten items and two-day location history.</p>\n\n<p>Still, most of the good stuff — like 30-day location history, unlimited sharing with friends and family, free replacements for damaged Tiles, and up to $100 reimbursement for lost items — sits behind a $29.99/year subscription. Fortunately, Tile offers new members a one-year free trial, and one subscription covers all your devices. You also still get a lot of core functionality without paying: you can find your Tile via Bluetooth, view its last known location on a map, ring your phone from the Tile, and share access with one other person for free.</p>\n\n<p>Tile also stands out for its versatility. While AirTags come in a single puck-like design, Tile offers four distinct form factors to suit different needs. The card-shaped <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fproduct%2Fblack-slim&amp;xcust=__vg0626awD__23533881__________________platform.theverge.com\">Tile Slim</a> ($29.99), for example, is the best option if you’re constantly losing your wallet. The square <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fproduct%2Fblack-mate&amp;xcust=__vg0626awD__23533881__________________platform.theverge.com\">Tile Mate</a> ($24.99) comes with a hole so you can stick it on a key ring or carabiner, and is probably the most versatile. The $24.99 <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fproduct%2Fblack-sticker&amp;xcust=__vg0626awD__23533881__________________platform.theverge.com\">Tile Sticker</a>, meanwhile, is a small disc that comes with a sticky backing so you can put it on remotes, pet collars, and anything else you can stick it on.</p>\n\n<p>The best Tile will depend on what you’re looking to track. My personal favorite, however, is the $34.99 <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fproduct%2Fblack-pro&amp;xcust=__vg0626awD__23533881__________________platform.theverge.com\">Tile Pro</a>, which is shaped like a key fob, is larger than the Mate, and can also be attached to other items. Of the four, it has the longest Bluetooth range at 500 feet and the loudest ring. It’s also the only one that has a replaceable one-year CR2032 battery.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24746419/DSC00034.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Back of Tile tracker with QR code\" title=\"Back of Tile tracker with QR code\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The back of the Tile Pro now has a QR code.

Just know that to use it, Tile requires you to submit a government ID for verification, agree to Tile working with law enforcement without a subpoena, and consent to a $1 million fine if you misuse this feature. For anti-stalking measures, Tile also has a “<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tile.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Ftile-introduces-scan-and-secure-feature-unwanted-tracking-safety&amp;xcust=__vg0626awD__23533881__________________\">Scan and Secure</a>” feature, which allows you to use the Tile app to scan for unknown Tile devices in your vicinity. While better than nothing, it’s a flawed measure, as it requires the potential victim to proactively scan their surroundings.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-best-airtag-and-tile-alternative\">The best AirTag and Tile alternative</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Pebblebee Clip Universal</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Pebblebee Clip Universal supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, but also has a 500-foot Bluetooth range, LEDs that flash to help you locate it, and a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 12 months on a single charge.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/google-find-my-device-trackers-13.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A Pebblebee Clip tracker with the light on\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://pebblebee.com/products/pebblebee-clip-universal\"> <strike>$34.99</strike> $27.99 at <strong>Pebblebee (with code FREEDOMTOFIND20)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pebblebee-Tracker-Clip-Universal-Rechargeable/dp/B0DHXY2MDN/\"> $34.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/pebblebee-clip-universal-rechargeable-item-tracker-works-with-android-find-my-device-or-apple-find-my-black/6593435.p\"> $34.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p>If you’re looking for an AirTag or Tile alternative, the Pebblebee Clip Universal is an excellent choice. It’s one of a growing number of trackers that support both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, a major improvement over its predecessor. This makes setup seamless for both iOS and Android users, while also enabling more accurate and reliable tracking than Pebblebee’s own network could provide. </p>\n\n<p>The thing I like best about the Pebblebee Clip Universal is its rechargeable battery. A single charge lasts up to one year, up from six months — though you may get longer than that depending on your usage. It has a USB-C port, too, so you don’t have to sweat it if you lose the charger it comes with. You love to see it.</p>\n\n<p>The Pebblebee Clip Universal also has an LED strip at the bottom that lights up when you ring the tracker. That’s helped me spot my car keys more quickly when they’ve fallen under the car seat or other dark areas. The ringtone is also quite loud, and the 500-foot Bluetooth range is actually about 100 feet more than the Tile Pro, our pick for Android users. And while larger than an AirTag, the Pebblebee Clip Universal also comes with a snap-on key ring so you don’t have to buy another accessory to attach it. It’s also IPX6-rated for water resistance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Clip Universal owners can still use Pebblebee’s<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pebblebee.app.hive3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1\"> app</a> to set voice tags and ask Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to help find their device. You can also use the “Find Phone” feature, which lets you double-tap to ring your phone.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, Clip Universal owners can’t use the Pebblebee app for tracking, and so only last-gen Clip owners can take advantage of the Pebblebee app’s extensive customizable geofencing features. That means, for instance, Clip Universal owners can no longer set up custom areas on a map and be notified whenever a device enters or leaves the area.

Wallets are always exactly where they’re supposed to be, keys never go missing, and remotes never slip between the couch cushions. And then there’s the rest of us — the folks who can’t ever seem to find the thing that was right there a few seconds ago. For us, there are Bluetooth trackers.\nBluetooth trackers have been around for a long time, and they all generally work the same way. You stick the tracker onto an object, pair it with your phone, and then, when you lose said object, you can go into an app and ring the tracker. But these days, Bluetooth trackers can do a lot more. Some have ultra-wideband chips that enable precision tracking, so you can find exactly where in a room your item is. Increasingly, trackers also tap into large networks — like Apple’s and Google’s — making it easier to locate lost items outside the home. Many will notify you if they detect you’ve left the device behind or come with QR codes that link to your contact information so people can easily return lost devices.\nThese features are incredibly handy but also have the potential for misuse. Take AirTags. When Apple launched the trackers, it hadn’t anticipated they’d be used to track people or stolen items — but that’s exactly what happened. It’s since beefed up its anti-stalking features, and companies like Tile have also followed suit. Apple and Google have launched a standard that enables unwanted tracking alerts across both Android and iOS devices — and major players like Tile, Samsung, and Chipolo are on board. But until this standard is up and running, it pays to be aware of each tracker’s current approach when you’re deciding the best option for you.\nAs a consummate Loser of Things, I’ve tested my fair share of Bluetooth trackers on wallets, keys, and luggage. Here’s what I’d recommend if you, too, have a hard time finding things.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best tracker for iPhone users\nThe best Bluetooth tracker for Android users\nThe best AirTag and Tile alternative\nThe best AirTag alternatives for wallets\nOther Bluetooth trackers to consider\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best tracker for iPhone users\nApple AirTag\nApple’s AirTags can help you find your lost items with their ultra wideband technology. You’ll get the best compatibility with an iPhone, though Apple released an Android app that can detect an AirTag’s location and notify you if one seems to be following you.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29 $22.99 at Amazon\n $29 $22.99 at Walmart\n $29 $22.99 at Best Buy\n\nWhen Apple launched AirTags in 2021, it really did shake up the category. That’s because AirTags are equipped with Apple’s Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip and tap into Apple’s vast Find My network. That’s a potent combo. And even though you can now get third-party accessories that work with the Find My network — including the Pebblebee trackers featured later in this guide — AirTags are still the best, thanks to UWB. \nBasically, UWB enables precision tracking while Find My compatibility expands range far, far beyond Bluetooth’s limitations. With precision tracking, all you have to do is open the Find My app, tap “Find,” and you should see an arrow pointing you in the exact direction you need to go to find your item. Using the Find My network also means that so long as there’s an Apple device nearby, a lost AirTag can ping its location to Apple’s iCloud servers without notifying the owners of those other devices. And there are over a billion Apple products out there.\nThat accuracy is super convenient. My keys fell out of my pocket while running once, and I didn’t notice until my phone pinged me to say my keys were no longer with me. While I wasn’t able to use the precision tracking outdoors, I could see the last reported location in the Find My app. Twenty minutes had already passed, but I still was able to find my keys. I haven’t had that degree of success with any other item tracker.\nHowever, this accuracy is a double-edged sword. In 2022, I ran a test to see whether I could track a friend and my spouse (with their consent) in real time. And I could, to a disturbing degree. While Apple’s unwanted tracking prevention measures worked, there were also inherent flaws. (You can read about our testing in full here.) However, Apple has since improved unwanted tracking alerts by shortening the time before you’re notified an unknown AirTag is in your vicinity, making chimes louder, and creating a separate app that lets Android users scan for unknown AirTags. Apple also now informs users during setup that unwanted tracking is a crime and that AirTags are “intended solely to track items that belong to you.”\nApple has also added more ways to share AirTag locations with trusted people. iOS 17 introduced AirTag sharing, which means shared items won’t trigger unwanted tracking alerts. As of iOS 18.2, you can also share the location of a lost AirTag with other people via a temporary link. So if an airline loses your luggage, you can send them a link that shows them an interactive map of your item’s last known location. (Apple is partnering with more than 15 airlines for this particular use case.)\nThe only thing I really don’t like about AirTags is they aren’t truly $29. They’re $29 plus the cost of whatever accessory is needed to attach them to the item you want to track. For example, you’ll need a holder to attach it to your keys or luggage. Thankfully, there’s a robust third-party accessory market, so you don’t have to pay Apple’s prices if you don’t want to. The fact that you can easily replace the battery with a regular CR2032 coin cell battery helps take the sting out, too. I just did it for two of my AirTags, and it was much, much cheaper than having to buy two new ones.\nRead our original AirTags review.\nThe best Bluetooth tracker for Android users\nTile Pro\nThe Tile Pro is the company’s loudest Bluetooth tracker and has the widest range at 400 feet. It also has a user-replaceable battery, unlike other Tiles.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $34.99 at Amazon\n $34.99 at Best Buy\n $34.99 at Target\n\nMore and more trackers now support both Google’s and Apple’s Find My networks, but Tile’s trackers — especially the $34.99 Tile Pro — are still our top recommendation for Android users or mixed iOS / Android households. Functionally, the platform-agnostic trackers can do just about anything an AirTag can. Like AirTags, Tile devices can tap into a larger network — in this case, the Tile Network and Amazon Sidewalk — to help you find your devices outside of your phone’s Bluetooth range. While this network isn’t as expansive as Apple’s or Google’s, Amazon Sidewalk’s coverage has improved significantly. In our April 2025 testing of Google’s Find Hub-compatible trackers — including the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and the Moto Tag — we found that Tile still did better at tracking items outside the home. \nUnfortunately, Tile still can’t do true real-time tracking, and it still doesn’t offer a tracker with UWB, so it lacks the AirTag’s precision tracking. The company announced one back in 2021, but we’re still waiting, partly because Apple is effectively blocking UWB compatibility for third parties in iOS and because Tile’s priorities shifted once it was acquired by Life360. \nA note about Google’s Find Hub network\nIn 2024, Google finally launched its Find My Device network, which was recently renamed Find Hub. It works similarly to Apple’s Find My network: you’ll be able to share trackers with family members, and there are also unwanted tracking alerts.\nInitially, the network lagged behind Apple’s, but it’s starting to catch up. After several weeks of testing Find Hub-compatible trackers — specifically the Chipolo Pop, Pebblebee Clip Universal, and Moto Tag — in April 2025, we found the network’s improved significantly over the past year, more so in busy areas. Still, it’s clear Google prioritized privacy over precision.\nThat balance may shift, though. In May 2025, Google added UWB support for more accurate tracking with Motorola’s Moto Tag and, eventually, other compatible phones and trackers. Google also plans to roll out satellite connectivity later later in 2025, with the ability to share tracker locations with airline staff arriving in early 2026.\nThat said, Life360’s acquisition has brought some meaningful upgrades. Pressing a Tile button three times now sends an SOS alert to emergency contacts through Life360. You can also add others to your Circle so they can view and ring nearby Tiles on a shared Life360 map. More recently, Tile trackers have become fully integrated into Life360, letting users manage their trackers directly within the Life360 app. This merger unlocked a few premium features for free, including push alerts for forgotten items and two-day location history.\nStill, most of the good stuff — like 30-day location history, unlimited sharing with friends and family, free replacements for damaged Tiles, and up to $100 reimbursement for lost items — sits behind a $29.99/year subscription. Fortunately, Tile offers new members a one-year free trial, and one subscription covers all your devices. You also still get a lot of core functionality without paying: you can find your Tile via Bluetooth, view its last known location on a map, ring your phone from the Tile, and share access with one other person for free.\nTile also stands out for its versatility. While AirTags come in a single puck-like design, Tile offers four distinct form factors to suit different needs. The card-shaped Tile Slim ($29.99), for example, is the best option if you’re constantly losing your wallet. The square Tile Mate ($24.99) comes with a hole so you can stick it on a key ring or carabiner, and is probably the most versatile. The $24.99 Tile Sticker, meanwhile, is a small disc that comes with a sticky backing so you can put it on remotes, pet collars, and anything else you can stick it on.\nThe best Tile will depend on what you’re looking to track. My personal favorite, however, is the $34.99 Tile Pro, which is shaped like a key fob, is larger than the Mate, and can also be attached to other items. Of the four, it has the longest Bluetooth range at 500 feet and the loudest ring. It’s also the only one that has a replaceable one-year CR2032 battery. \nLast but not least, Tile may actually be better than AirTags for tracking stolen items. The company rolled out an anti-theft feature in 2023, which renders Tile devices invisible to unwanted tracking detection in the event someone steals your item. Just know that to use it, Tile requires you to submit a government ID for verification, agree to Tile working with law enforcement without a subpoena, and consent to a $1 million fine if you misuse this feature. For anti-stalking measures, Tile also has a “Scan and Secure” feature, which allows you to use the Tile app to scan for unknown Tile devices in your vicinity. While better than nothing, it’s a flawed measure, as it requires the potential victim to proactively scan their surroundings. \n\n\nThe best AirTag and Tile alternative\nPebblebee Clip Universal\nThe Pebblebee Clip Universal supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, but also has a 500-foot Bluetooth range, LEDs that flash to help you locate it, and a rechargeable battery that lasts up to 12 months on a single charge.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $34.99 $27.99 at Pebblebee (with code FREEDOMTOFIND20)\n $34.99 at Amazon\n $34.99 at Best Buy\n\nIf you’re looking for an AirTag or Tile alternative, the Pebblebee Clip Universal is an excellent choice. It’s one of a growing number of trackers that support both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, a major improvement over its predecessor. This makes setup seamless for both iOS and Android users, while also enabling more accurate and reliable tracking than Pebblebee’s own network could provide. \nThe thing I like best about the Pebblebee Clip Universal is its rechargeable battery. A single charge lasts up to one year, up from six months — though you may get longer than that depending on your usage. It has a USB-C port, too, so you don’t have to sweat it if you lose the charger it comes with. You love to see it.\nThe Pebblebee Clip Universal also has an LED strip at the bottom that lights up when you ring the tracker. That’s helped me spot my car keys more quickly when they’ve fallen under the car seat or other dark areas. The ringtone is also quite loud, and the 500-foot Bluetooth range is actually about 100 feet more than the Tile Pro, our pick for Android users. And while larger than an AirTag, the Pebblebee Clip Universal also comes with a snap-on key ring so you don’t have to buy another accessory to attach it. It’s also IPX6-rated for water resistance.\nClip Universal owners can still use Pebblebee’s app to set voice tags and ask Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to help find their device. You can also use the “Find Phone” feature, which lets you double-tap to ring your phone.\nThat said, Clip Universal owners can’t use the Pebblebee app for tracking, and so only last-gen Clip owners can take advantage of the Pebblebee app’s extensive customizable geofencing features. That means, for instance, Clip Universal owners can no longer set up custom areas on a map and be notified whenever a device enters or leaves the area. They also can’t use the app to designate safe zones, which was useful to avoid unnecessary “left behind” notifications in familiar places like home or work. The latter can be done in Apple’s Find My app, though Google’s Find Hub doesn’t yet have an equivalent feature.\nThe best AirTag alternatives for wallets\nPebblebee Card Universal\nThe Pebblebee Card has a rechargeable battery that lasts for up to 18 months. It supports Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub, but you can also use the Pebblebee app for voice tagging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $34.99 $27.99 at Pebblebee (with code FREEDOMTOFIND20)\n $34.99 at Amazon\n $34.99 at Best Buy\n\nYou could be like my spouse, who stuffs an AirTag in their bifold wallet and then makes a surprised Pikachu face every time it falls out. Or, you could opt for a Find My-compatible alternative specifically designed for wallets, like the $34.99 Pebblebee Card Universal. It plays nice with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub networks, giving you cross-platform flexibility and the benefits of each — all with a super loud ringtone. It doesn’t come with precision tracking because it lacks UWB, but it makes up for it with those loud ringtones. As part of the Find My network, it also supports unwanted tracking alerts. \nThe Pebblebee Card Universal also stands out because of its rechargeable battery, which lasts up to 18 months on a single charge. Like the Pebblebee Clip Universal, it works with the Pebblebee app to support voice tagging and even has a button you can press to locate your phone. \nOther Bluetooth trackers to consider\nThe $16.88 $29.99 Eufy Security SmartTrack Card is another good option designed for wallets. It comes with a little clip attachment so it doesn’t have to be stuffed in your wallet; you could clip it onto a laptop case, for example. This also has the same benefits when used with the Find My network as the Pebblebee Card Universal. On the back, there’s also a QR code — similar to the ones Tile uses — that helps good samaritans return your item to you. Like the Pebblebee Card Universal, you can share it with multiple people if you set it up via the Eufy Security app. The bummer here is it doesn’t work with Android, lacks UWB and a replaceable battery, and isn’t rechargeable like its successor, Eufy’s $29.99 34.99 SmartTrack Card E30. That said, though, the built-in battery should purportedly last you three years.\nThe $29 $35 Chipolo Card Spot or $24 $35 Card Point is also a good option for wallets if you want something a bit simpler, though it lacks the QR code, and its battery only lasts two years. If you do opt for Chipolo, double-check that the specific tracker you’re buying works on the network you want to use. For example, the Chipolo Card and Chipolo Card Spot can both be used with iPhones, but the Chipolo Card only works with the Chipolo app, while the Card Spot only works with Find My. The Chipolo Card Point is for Android users and works with Google’s Find Hub network. Read my full Chipolo Card Spot review.\nIf you’re a Samsung Galaxy phone user, the $29.99 Samsung SmartTag2 gets you UWB tracking and can tap into the Galaxy Find network, which operates similarly to Apple’s Find My network. It’s a great AirTag alternative but isn’t our overall pick for Android because it’s limited to Samsung Galaxy users. But for Samsung users, the latest SmartTag2 includes an improved Compass View, longer battery life, and a better app experience. It’s also got a newer oblong design with a larger key ring than the original SmartTag.\nWhat’s coming next\nMotorola’s $29 Moto Tag is the first tracker on Google’s Find Hub network to offer UWB for locating lost items, which is functionality Google recently enabled via a firmware update. Even more conveniently, it’s compatible with Apple’s Find My network, too, and is designed to fit in accessories made for AirTags.

Like Pebblebee’s trackers, it can ring your phone if you’ve misplaced it. As a bonus, it doubles as a remote shutter for Motorola phone cameras. \nChipolo has announced the Chipolo Pop, a $29 Bluetooth tracker offered in six bright colors.
