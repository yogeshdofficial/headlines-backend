We’ve also included notes on historical pricing trends, so you can see how they stack up against previous deals.

They also offer a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a case with a built-in speaker that makes tracking easy via Apple’s Find My feature. Read our review.\nIf you don’t need active noise cancellation, the Beats Solo 4 are also on sale for around $97.99 ($102 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and $99.99 at Target.

Read our review.\nYou can buy the latest iPad with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart starting at $279 ($70 off), which beats its best price by $20. The 11th-gen model is a pretty minor upgrade over the 2022 iPad with twice as much base storage and an A16 Bionic chip, which, while faster, doesn’t support the AI-based Apple Intelligence features.

We’ve collected the best deals we could find on everything from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/700846/amazon-prime-day-best-noise-canceling-headphone-earbud-deals-2025\">noise-canceling headphones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/698188/robot-vacuum-mop-deals-amazon-prime-day\">robot vacuums</a> to the latest tablets and TVs, the bulk of which have been tried and tested by <em>Verge</em> writers and editors. We put as much confidence in our budget-friendly battery picks as we do the pricier gaming monitors we’ve included.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prime Day’s extended runtime this year is giving you more time to shop, though don’t wait for entirely new sets of deals to drop everyday. There’ll be some lightning deals and single-day discounts, which we’ll be sure to highlight, but the big benefit is avoiding disappointment from missing a deep discount because you slept on it. We’re delighted to see many gadget deals, including the $100 off deal on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Bluetooth-Headphones-Personalized-Effortless/dp/B0DGHMNQ5Z/\">Apple’s AirPods 4</a> and the $50 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3S-256GB-All-One/dp/B0F2GYMC8H/\">Meta Quest 3S<strong> </strong>headset</a> discount, are still available. We don’t expect to see them this heavily discounted again until Black Friday rolls around, and even then, these deals aren’t guaranteed to come back.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"prime-day-highlights\">Prime Day highlights</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It’s no Switch 2 deal, but Woot is selling the <strong>last-gen Switch OLED</strong> for the lowest price we’ve seen yet. The console with blue and red neon Joy-Con is $249.99 at <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-neon-blue-red-international-model\">Woot</a>, while the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes the game is $275.99 at the <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-nintendo-switch-oled-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle-international-model\">retailer</a>, while supplies last. Note: these are international versions, which run just fine in the US, but they only have a 90-day Woot warranty instead of a 1-year manufacturer warranty.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple’s 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip</strong> has no business being a good value still in 2025. The laptop’s design is the most outdated thing about it, but its processor, along with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage make it a good entry-level Mac, especially at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/715596133\">Walmart</a>’s discounted $599.99 price (was $649.99).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A solid soundbar that can automatically rotate itself to fire sound upwards for Dolby Atmos content seems like it’d be expensive, but <strong>Vizio’s 5.1.2. Elevate SE system</strong> is actually just $299 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXR1G2RD\">Amazon</a> ($200 off).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>GameSir G8 Plus</strong> is one versatile mobile gaming controller, and it’s down to its lowest price of $49.99 at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/8698108756\">Walmart</a> (usually $79.99). This model can stretch to fit around phones and tablets as big as the iPad Mini. Alternatively, you can slot a Nintendo Switch into the grip, if you prefer its bulkier design to that of the Joy-Con.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keep mosquitos at bay with <strong>Thermacell’s rechargeable repeller</strong>, which costs $17.68 (half off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PDNCMMN?th=1\">Amazon</a> for the version that lasts five hours per charge. It runs on cartridges, but a 12-hour one is included in the box.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It’s a good time to need new AirPods, because <strong>Apple’s AirPods Pro</strong> that come with a USB-C charging case are $100 off for the first time at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C/5689919121\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382.p?\">Best Buy</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Genki’s small M.2 2230-sized enclosure called the <strong>SavePoint</strong> is $39.99 when you clip the on-page coupon at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-SavePoint-Enclosure-Compatible-Passthrough/dp/B0F5M5QTTJ/\">Amazon</a>. You can use it as a speedy USB-C SSD with any device, but it shines when connected to a Steam Deck because it has two USB-C ports (one for data, the other for power passthrough to keep the handheld charged). Here’s how to use it to <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/gaming/501039/steam-deck-how-to-install-windows-11-guide\">run Windows on your Steam Deck</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hoto’s rechargeable screwdriver</strong> is a both a <em>Verge</em>-favorite and a reader-favorite, and it’s discounted for Prime Day. It’s $36.09 (originally $79.99) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOTO-Electric-Screwdriver-Cordless-Mechanical/dp/B0BLMQ8BXB\">Amazon</a> for the 3.6V screwdriver, 25 steel bits, and a sleek carrying case to contain it all.

The entry-level earbuds offer reliable performance and satisfactory sound — especially at this price — though they lack wireless charging, multipoint support, and some of the newer frills found on Samsung’s flagship earbuds.

The gorgeously-animated film is a bit of a tear-jerker.

We’ve collected the best deals we could find on everything from noise-canceling headphones and robot vacuums to the latest tablets and TVs, the bulk of which have been tried and tested by Verge writers and editors. We put as much confidence in our budget-friendly battery picks as we do the pricier gaming monitors we’ve included.\nPrime Day’s extended runtime this year is giving you more time to shop, though don’t wait for entirely new sets of deals to drop everyday. There’ll be some lightning deals and single-day discounts, which we’ll be sure to highlight, but the big benefit is avoiding disappointment from missing a deep discount because you slept on it. We’re delighted to see many gadget deals, including the $100 off deal on Apple’s AirPods 4 and the $50 Meta Quest 3S headset discount, are still available. We don’t expect to see them this heavily discounted again until Black Friday rolls around, and even then, these deals aren’t guaranteed to come back.\nPrime Day highlights\nIt’s no Switch 2 deal, but Woot is selling the last-gen Switch OLED for the lowest price we’ve seen yet. The console with blue and red neon Joy-Con is $249.99 at Woot, while the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle that includes the game is $275.99 at the retailer, while supplies last. Note: these are international versions, which run just fine in the US, but they only have a 90-day Woot warranty instead of a 1-year manufacturer warranty.\nApple’s 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip has no business being a good value still in 2025. The laptop’s design is the most outdated thing about it, but its processor, along with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage make it a good entry-level Mac, especially at Walmart’s discounted $599.99 price (was $649.99).\nA solid soundbar that can automatically rotate itself to fire sound upwards for Dolby Atmos content seems like it’d be expensive, but Vizio’s 5.1.2. Elevate SE system is actually just $299 at Amazon ($200 off).\nThe GameSir G8 Plus is one versatile mobile gaming controller, and it’s down to its lowest price of $49.99 at Walmart (usually $79.99). This model can stretch to fit around phones and tablets as big as the iPad Mini. Alternatively, you can slot a Nintendo Switch into the grip, if you prefer its bulkier design to that of the Joy-Con.\nKeep mosquitos at bay with Thermacell’s rechargeable repeller, which costs $17.68 (half off) at Amazon for the version that lasts five hours per charge. It runs on cartridges, but a 12-hour one is included in the box.\nIt’s a good time to need new AirPods, because Apple’s AirPods Pro that come with a USB-C charging case are $100 off for the first time at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.\nGenki’s small M.2 2230-sized enclosure called the SavePoint is $39.99 when you clip the on-page coupon at Amazon. You can use it as a speedy USB-C SSD with any device, but it shines when connected to a Steam Deck because it has two USB-C ports (one for data, the other for power passthrough to keep the handheld charged). Here’s how to use it to run Windows on your Steam Deck.\nHoto’s rechargeable screwdriver is a both a Verge-favorite and a reader-favorite, and it’s discounted for Prime Day. It’s $36.09 (originally $79.99) at Amazon for the 3.6V screwdriver, 25 steel bits, and a sleek carrying case to contain it all. There’s an on-page coupon to save an extra 10 percent, too.\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nSonos Ace\nThe Sonos Ace are the company’s first set of wireless headphones. They feature a premium, comfortable build and active noise cancellation, along with compatibility with Sonos Arc and other Sonos soundbars. Read our review. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449 $299 at Amazon\n $449 $299 at Best Buy\n $449 $299 at Sonos\n\n\nAirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C\nThe second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, sound quality, and onboard volume controls. The latest refresh also ships with a USB-C charging case, as opposed to Lightning.

However, they lack immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $359 $229 at Amazon\n $359 $229 at Best Buy\n $359.99 $229.99 at Target\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Buds FE are a decent-sounding pair of earbuds with ANC, and they’re down to a new low $52.24 ($47 off) at Amazon. The entry-level earbuds offer reliable performance and satisfactory sound — especially at this price — though they lack wireless charging, multipoint support, and some of the newer frills found on Samsung’s flagship earbuds. That said, they also come with a pair of silicone “wings” to help them stay firmly planted in place, which some considered a hallmark of prior models. Read our review.\nIf you’re an Apple user, there’s no better pair of starter buds than the open-style AirPods 4, which have fallen to a new low of $89 ($41 off) at Amazon and Walmart. The latest model sounds significantly better than the third-gen pair, particularly when it comes to voice calls. More importantly, they offer robust integration with the rest of the Apple ecosystem, letting you take advantage of audio sharing, automatic device switching, hands-free “Hey Siri” commands, Apple TV integration, and more. Read our review.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nSamsung’s premium Galaxy Buds 3 Pro sport the same stem-based design and pinch gestures as the standard Galaxy Buds 3, only they deliver better sound, improved ANC, and an in-ear fit with silicone tips. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $166.24 at Amazon\n $249.99 $166.24 at Best Buy\n $249.99 $189.99 at Samsung\n\nGoogle’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 are on sale at Amazon for $160.55 ($69 off), which is their best price to date. They’re a pretty notable step up from the prior model — particularly if you use a Pixel phone — with a smaller build, an excellent transparency mode, and some of the best battery life you can get in a pair of noise-canceling earbuds. Read our review.\nSony’s newer WH-1000XM6 are our No. 1 pick for the best ANC headphones, but the prior model remains an excellent alternative at $298, their current price on Amazon. The WH-1000XM5 still offer top-tier noise cancellation and superb sound, along with a helpful transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth support, and other handy features. The only real downside, aside from the plasticky build, is the fact that they don’t fold down like the XM4 and this year’s XM6. Read our review.\nSony WH-1000XM4\nSony’s last-last-gen ANC headphones still offer great sound, last up to 30 hours on a single charge, and provide a comfortable listening experience thanks to their plush ear pads.

Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $89.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $89.95 at Walmart\n $169.95 $89.99 at Best Buy\n\nOther than the Beats Studio Buds Plus above, there aren’t a ton of reputable pairs of wireless earbuds that rely on a see-through design. The newer WF-C710N do, however, and they’ve reached a new low price of $78 ($41 off) at Amazon for Prime Day. What’s more, the budget-minded earbuds also borrow some tricks from Sony’s pricier earbuds, including improved noise cancellation and battery life, an automatic pause feature, and touch buttons that allow you to control playback without whipping out your phone.\nSony’s Float headphones are currently down to $78 ($52 off) at Amazon, which is significantly less than their previous low of $108. The Float represent Sony’s take on open-ear headphones, and while we haven’t had a chance to test them (yet), they seem to offer similar features to their like-minded rivals, including IPX4 water resistance, USB-C charging, and generous ear hooks that are designed to keep them firmly in place while you run.\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same general design as the company’s previous earbuds — but you can get these in a snazzy yellow. They include ANC, more than decent sound quality, and other features like multipoint for just under $100. Read our impressions.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $69 at Amazon\n $99 $69 at Nothing\n\n\nShokz OpenRun Pro 2\nShokz’ best bone conduction headphones yet, with more booming bass than its predecessor. Our reviewer Victoria Song praised their cozy fit as well as their USB-C charging (goodbye, proprietary charger!). Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 $124.99 at Best Buy\n $179.95 $124.95 at Amazon\n $179.95 $124.95 at Walmart\n\nThe recently released Skullcandy Method 360 ANC are down to a new low of $75.99 ($50 off) at Amazon for Prime Day. They’re basically a pair of low-end Bose earbuds in disguise — hell, they even use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose — which means they offer well-balanced sound, solid battery life, and a number of great features for the price. They also block noise more effectively than previous Skullcandy offerings and come in an array of fun colors, including a chic leopard print.\nThe Shokz OpenFit are currently on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $109.95 ($50 off), a new low. Like other pairs of Shokz earbuds, they feature a lightweight, open-style design that’s well-suited for both the gym and everyday use, with an IP55 water resistance rating, relatively clear sound, and a decent amount of low-end thump despite their less conventional design.

It supports 45W output through its built-in USB-C cable, and has an extra USB-C port, plus a USB-A port. You can snag one for $24.69, down from its original $39.99 price at Amazon.\nYou can keep your iPhone and AirPods charged with Belkin’s MagSafe 2-in-1 wireless charging stand, which is down to $59.99 ($4o off) at Amazon, nearly matching its best price to date. While similar models from other brands are often cheaper, this one looks better than most, and it hasn’t sunk this low in price since mid-2023. Belkin’s option also includes a power adapter.\nThe Baseus PrimeTrip VR2 Max has been one of the most popular products for Verge readers recently. The 4-in-1 car charger can put out a combined 163W of power and features two retractable USB-C cables, plus two USB-A ports. It’s tough not to love, especially at its Amazon price of $29.99 ($20 off).\nTwelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe\nTwelve South’s 3-in-1 charging stand offers full 15W MagSafe iPhone charging and can simultaneously top up a set of AirPods while fast-charging a compatible Apple Watch.

The cellular version is on sale at Amazon for $179.99 ($120 off). Its battery life isn’t as good as the Pixel Watch 3, and it’s missing a few features, but it’s otherwise a solid alternative if you’re trying to save a little cash.

Read our review.\nThe Garmin Lily 2 has returned to its all-time low of $199.99 ($50 off) at Amazon. While Garmin makes plenty of trackers for enthusiast fitness folks, the Lily 2 is a more pared-back experience for casual users.
