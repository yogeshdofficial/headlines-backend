From tablets to smartwatches, the early deals are already starting to trickle in. Prices might drop even further during Amazon’s four-day sales event, sure, but gadgets like the latest iPad Air are already matching their all-time low, giving you a solid chance to save before the four-day shopping event officially kicks off on July 8th. Even better, you don’t need to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of the current deals, as retailers other than Amazon are offering the same discounts across the board.\nBelow, we’ve gathered the best discounts across a variety of categories to make your shopping easier. To help you make an informed decision, we’ve also included notes on historical pricing trends, so you can see how they stack up against previous deals.

It also features a sharper 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam and supports two external displays with the lid open, making it even better for multitasking.

After cleaning, the robovac can automatically return to the included charging base and deposit debris and dirty water inside the dock (in separate reservoirs, of course).</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Ring Doorbell Battery with Ring Indoor Cam</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25698548/ring_battery_doorbell_2024.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Ring Battery Doorbell mounted on house\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9344TXC\"> <strike>$139.99</strike> $69.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div><div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Bird Buddy Pro</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Bird Buddy’s charming, camera-equipped feeder identifies and snaps shots of each bird that stops by, supplementing its 5-megapixel stills with insightful facts via an app.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Bird-Buddy-Pro-Press-Image.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Buddy-Solar-Feeder-Camera/dp/B0DHY6CQBC\"> <strike>$329</strike> $179.1 at <strong>Amazon (non-solar)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://mybirdbuddy.com/product/smart-bird-feeder-pro/\"> <strike>$329</strike> $199 at <strong>Bird Buddy (non-solar)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.chewy.com/bird-buddy-solar-smart-bird-feeder/dp/1497566/\"> <strike>$311.25</strike> $199 at <strong>Chewy (solar)</strong></a></li></ul></div><div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Jackery Explorer 1000 V2</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 offers a higher 1,500W output than its predecessor, along with two USB-C ports, one USB-A port, a DC car port, three AC outlets, and a built-in LED light.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/jackery100.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Explorer-Portable-Generator-Emergency/dp/B0D7PPG25F\"> <strike>$799</strike> $448.98 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.jackery.com/products/explorer-1000-portable-power-station\"> <strike>$799</strike> $449 at <strong>Jackery</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>second-gen Echo Buds</strong> are<span> down to $44.99 ($95 off) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds-Wireless-Charging-Case/dp/B085WTWYS4\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, matching</span> the lowest price we’ve seen on the model with the wireless charging case.

While steeper discounts will surely arrive shortly, many of the current offers are already worth considering, especially if you’re a Prime member looking to score a deal on one of Amazon’s own devices or services. Most of these offers are exclusive to Prime members; however, some retailers are price-matching Amazon’s deals, meaning non-members can still take advantage of some of the same savings.\nFrom record lows on security gear and power stations to a solid deal on what’s already an affordable streaming device, here are our top picks. \nWe’ll be updating this guide over the next week as new deals drop, so be sure to check back if you want to stay on top of the latest deals. We also suggest bookmarking our main Prime Day hub for additional tips and insights into what is likely going to be one of the biggest shopping events of the year.\nAmazon Fire HD 10 (2023)\nThe 2023 Amazon Fire HD 10 sports a 10.1-inch, 1080p display and 3GB of RAM, which is plenty if you’re streaming or browsing. It’s lighter than the last-gen model, too, and comes with support for both the Made for Amazon Stylus Pen and Amazon’s handwriting recognition technology.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $139.99 $69.99 at Amazon (32GB, with ads)\n $179.99 $79.99 at Amazon (64GB, with ads)\n $154.99 $84.99 at Amazon (32GB, without ads)\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K (2023)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $49.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $49.99 $24.99 at Best Buy\n $49.99 $28.99 at B&H Photo\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube (third-gen)\nThe hybrid Echo and Fire TV is faster than its predecessor with extensive hands-free voice control capabilities, support for Wi-Fi 6E, and excellent performance.

Although it was built primarily for Amazon’s cloud-gaming service, the gamepad offers support for both Bluetooth and USB-C connectivity, rendering it compatible with Android phones, Apple products, Fire TV devices, and PCs. It also integrates with Alexa, allowing you to issue voice commands directly through the controller when paired with a Fire TV device.\nSamsung’s 2TB T9 portable USB-C SSD is currently $169.99 ($130 off), its lowest price in over a year, at Amazon. The drive can read and write data at up to 2,000Mbps when connected to a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 port. The T9 has substantially faster data transfer speeds than an external spinning hard drive (it’s more reliable, too, since it has no moving parts). The drive is fast enough to store an uncompressed stream of 4K Pro Res video at 60 frames per second directly from an iPhone 15 Pro or newer. Amazon has also discounted the 4TB model to $319.99 ($230 off) if you need more space.\nAmazon Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series\nThe Fire TV Omni Mini-LED Series is one of Amazon’s top-tier TVs. It features fully-array local dimming, a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, and two HDMI 2.1 ports. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $819.99 $699.99 at Amazon (55-inch)\n $1099.99 $899.99 at Amazon (65-inch)\n $1499.99 $1299.99 at Amazon (75-inch)\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $149.99 at Amazon\n\n\nAmazon Echo Show 8 (third-gen)\nAmazon’s latest Echo Show 8 features spatial audio and room adaptation software for improved audio quality.

Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149.99 $109.99 at Amazon\n $149.99 at Best Buy\n $149.99 at Target\n\nRight now, Black & Decker’s dustbuster furbuster is available for $79.99 ($20 off) — one of its best prices to date — from Amazon, Lowe’s, and Black & Decker. The excellent handheld vacuum cleaner comes with a motorized pet brush with rubber bristles, which won’t get caught when you’re picking up hair. You can also use its extra-large, retractable crevice tool to clean tall places, or push the vacuum’s so-called “powerboost” button to maximize its suction power for dirt or hair that’s stuck deep within carpeting.\nIf you want cleaner floors, you can pick up Shark’s AV752 IO Robot Vacuum for $179.99 (about $70 off) at Amazon, which is one of the better prices we’ve seen as of late. The budget robovac uses three brushes to clean your floors and has sensors to avoid obstacles, including stairs, and it’s thin enough to fit beneath furniture. It can run for up to two hours per charge, and you can schedule cleanings using the SharkClean app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant.\nEcho Pop\nThe newer Echo Pop is one of Amazon’s smallest Alexa-enabled smart speakers. It offers a unique semisphere form factor and can function as an Eero mesh Wi-Fi extender. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $21.99 at Amazon\n $39.99 at Best Buy\n $39.99 at Target\n\n\nAmazon Echo Frames (2023)\nAmazon’s Echo Frames resemble a pair of stylish regular eyeglasses but can be used to listen to music, take calls, and perform a range of Alexa-enabled tasks. They also feature up to six hours of audio playback with their open-ear design. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $129.99 at Amazon (original)\n $389.99 $199.99 at Amazon (Carrera)\n\n\nAmazon Smart Air Quality Monitor\nAmazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor touts a compact design, voice alerts, and automated triggers that allow it to turn on air purifiers and other Alexa-enabled devices. It lacks a display, however, and pairs best with an Echo device. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $44.99 at Amazon (with Prime)\n\nYou can buy a Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam with a Ring Pet Tag for $44.99 ($44.99 off) at Amazon, which is a new low price. Ring’s Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam rotates 360 degrees on a motorized base, which you can control via the Ring app. The wired 1080p camera also offers a physical privacy cover — just like the second-gen Ring Indoor Cam — along with support for video and color night vision, two-way talk, motion detection, and a built-in siren. The Ring Pet Tag, on the other hand, attaches to your pet’s collar and links to a digital profile anyone can access via a QR code.\nThe Alexa Voice Remote Pro is now available for just $24.99 ($10 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, marking its lowest price to date. The backlit remote features a built-in remote finder, allowing you to quickly locate it using either Amazon’s Fire TV app or a compatible smart speaker. It also features customizable shortcut buttons that you can program to instantly launch your favorite apps, as well as compatibility with most Fire TV streaming devices and smart TVs.
