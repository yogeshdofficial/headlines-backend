But it’s not nearly enough given what’s at stake.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The company is considering June 12th as a possible date to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/tesla-targets-june-12-launch-of-robotaxi-service-in-austin?embedded-checkout=true\"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a> — though that date could change. Tesla has yet to publicly announce a date, nor has it clarified who will be able to access the vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The news comes as CEO Elon Musk said that the company has begun to test vehicles without safety drivers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“For the past several days, Tesla has been testing self-driving Model Y cars (no one in driver’s seat) on Austin public streets with no incidents,” <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1927970940874354941\">Musk said on X</a>. “A month ahead of schedule. Next month, first self-delivery from factory to customer.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“No incidents.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But before you give Musk too much credit for the milestone, keep in mind that we still know next to nothing about how this service will operate. Tesla has never publicly demonstrated that its vehicles can operate fully driverless, without a human safety driver behind the wheel, on public roads. We have seen them drive themselves within the confines of Tesla’s factory, which is an environment totally controlled by the company and nowhere near as complex as an active city street with pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25670862/Robotaxi_89.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Don’t expect to see this vehicle in Austin any time soon. &lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We know that Tesla plans to launch the service with 10–20 Model Y vehicles. Are these vehicles meaningfully different from the Model Ys that Tesla sells to its customers? It seems very likely, given that Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot and AI software, said in a recent earnings call that they would have “audio inputs” so they can pick up sirens from emergency vehicles, for example.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These vehicles will also be heavily teleoperated, meaning there will be remote operators watching the vehicles through their embedded cameras, ready to take control should a problem arise. But keep in mind this came from a research note published by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, not from Tesla itself. Jonas also said the service will be invite-only at launch. So unless you’re a Tesla investor, a social media influencer with a sizable following, or a close personal friend of Elon Musk’s, don’t make any immediate plans to travel to Austin next month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tesla’s approach to its self-driving service is a major departure from how robotaxi companies typically handle these types of launches. Waymo, which it should be noted operates the only publicly available robotaxi service in the US, tests its driverless vehicles for weeks, sometimes months, before opening them up to members of the public. And even then, the company only allows specific people, usually from a waitlist, to ride in its vehicles.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Tesla’s approach to its self-driving service is a major departure from how robotaxi companies typically handle these types of launches</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But before that, Waymo spends months driving manually around a city, gathering data about the streetscape and driving habits of other drivers. Sometimes it uses that information to launch a commercial robotaxi service; other times that data is just fed into Waymo’s central computer to make general improvements to its automated driving software.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Waymo is also relatively transparent about its process. Before it launched a robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, the company invited journalists from dozens of outlets to its testing facility in Castle, California, allowing them to ride in the vehicles on a closed course.

But it’s not nearly enough given what’s at stake.\nThe company is considering June 12th as a possible date to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Bloomberg reports — though that date could change. Tesla has yet to publicly announce a date, nor has it clarified who will be able to access the vehicles.\nThe news comes as CEO Elon Musk said that the company has begun to test vehicles without safety drivers. \n“For the past several days, Tesla has been testing self-driving Model Y cars (no one in driver’s seat) on Austin public streets with no incidents,” Musk said on X. “A month ahead of schedule. Next month, first self-delivery from factory to customer.”\n\n“No incidents.”\n\n\nBut before you give Musk too much credit for the milestone, keep in mind that we still know next to nothing about how this service will operate. Tesla has never publicly demonstrated that its vehicles can operate fully driverless, without a human safety driver behind the wheel, on public roads. We have seen them drive themselves within the confines of Tesla’s factory, which is an environment totally controlled by the company and nowhere near as complex as an active city street with pedestrians, cyclists, and other vulnerable road users.\nWe know that Tesla plans to launch the service with 10–20 Model Y vehicles. Are these vehicles meaningfully different from the Model Ys that Tesla sells to its customers? It seems very likely, given that Ashok Elluswamy, VP of Autopilot and AI software, said in a recent earnings call that they would have “audio inputs” so they can pick up sirens from emergency vehicles, for example.\nThese vehicles will also be heavily teleoperated, meaning there will be remote operators watching the vehicles through their embedded cameras, ready to take control should a problem arise. But keep in mind this came from a research note published by Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, not from Tesla itself. Jonas also said the service will be invite-only at launch. So unless you’re a Tesla investor, a social media influencer with a sizable following, or a close personal friend of Elon Musk’s, don’t make any immediate plans to travel to Austin next month.\nTesla’s approach to its self-driving service is a major departure from how robotaxi companies typically handle these types of launches. Waymo, which it should be noted operates the only publicly available robotaxi service in the US, tests its driverless vehicles for weeks, sometimes months, before opening them up to members of the public. And even then, the company only allows specific people, usually from a waitlist, to ride in its vehicles.\n\nTesla’s approach to its self-driving service is a major departure from how robotaxi companies typically handle these types of launches\n\n\nBut before that, Waymo spends months driving manually around a city, gathering data about the streetscape and driving habits of other drivers. Sometimes it uses that information to launch a commercial robotaxi service; other times that data is just fed into Waymo’s central computer to make general improvements to its automated driving software.\nWaymo is also relatively transparent about its process. Before it launched a robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, the company invited journalists from dozens of outlets to its testing facility in Castle, California, allowing them to ride in the vehicles on a closed course. Waymo has also released its own safety case, posted numerous blog posts about its approach to safety, and published a handful of peer-reviewed studies that demonstrates how its technology routinely behaves safer than human drivers. \nTesla, on the other hand, has said very little about the safety of its vehicles beyond the hype-filled statements of its chief executive.
