My general guidelines are to first pick the operating system you need (based on personal preference or class requirements), and then get the best specs you can afford. If your school has specific requirements or recommendations, they are likely found on the school website. A quality laptop should also have a good screen, keyboard, and trackpad — and preferably enough ports and some decent speakers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unless you’re buying a Chromebook, aim for an M4 processor (for Macs) or an Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7, an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series, or a Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor on a Windows machine, especially if you want your laptop to last at least four years. Aim for at least 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. If your budget allows for more RAM or storage then go for it, especially if neither is user-replaceable — it’ll help with performance and longevity. If you have to choose based on budget, prioritize RAM, since external storage is easily available.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taking much of that into account, here are our top picks among current laptops.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The best laptop for most students</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0049.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Easily lasts a full day on battery</li><li>Excellent choice for most people’s everyday needs</li><li>Nails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to be</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Still starts with just 256GB of storage</li><li>Still has limited ports</li><li>Still prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/\"> <strike>$999</strike> $849 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6565862.p\"> <strike>$999</strike> $849 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1883962-REG/apple_mw123ll_a_13_macbook_air_m4.html\"> <strike>$999</strike> $949 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unless you’re going into a field involving lots of graphics rendering or video editing, a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review\">MacBook Air</a> should be more than enough computer to last through the student years. The Air is our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">top laptop recommendation</a> for most people, and that includes students — particularly students in high school or starting college. Nothing else offers quite the same balance of performance, build quality, and battery life as Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s a speedy little machine that can even handle some heftier content creation work. Its battery can easily get you through a packed day of classes. And it has the best trackpad around. The only major downside with an Air (as with all modern MacBooks) is that you can’t upgrade the storage or memory after you buy it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now that MacBooks start with 16GB of RAM, even the base $999 13-inch model is excellent, if a little short on storage space at 256GB. So you may want to consider the $1,199 model with 512GB of storage. For the same price you can get the larger 15-inch model with roomier screen real estate and even better speakers, but then you’re once again starting with 256GB.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple MacBook Air 15 (2025, M4)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0183.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Easily lasts a full day on battery</li><li>Excellent choice for most people’s everyday needs</li><li>Nails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to be</li><li>Louder speakers over its smaller counterpart</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Still starts with just 256GB of storage</li><li>Still has limited ports</li><li>Still prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDBDCFH/\"> <strike>$1199</strike> $1049 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6565869.p\"> <strike>$1199</strike> $1049 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1883955-REG/apple_mc7a4ll_a_15_macbook_air_m4.html\"> <strike>$1199</strike> $1069 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review\">Read our review of the M4 MacBook Air.</a></h5>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-small-font-size\"><strong><strong>A note on older M-series Airs:</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The original M1 MacBook Air can <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889\">still be bought new</a> from Walmart for $649 or less.

That lingering M1 only has 8GB of RAM, and newer M2 and M3 versions have MagSafe chargers, better keyboards, and markedly better screens.

Apple’s base model <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\">14-inch MacBook Pro</a> is a step up from the MacBook Air, with the same M4 chip. Its starting price of $1,599 is a significant jump from a $999 Air, but you get better performance and a bunch of worthwhile upgrades. The Pro has more ports than the Air, including an SD card reader and HDMI 2.1. Its screen is a nicer Mini LED panel with higher resolution and faster refresh rate. It’s got more ports, including an SD card reader and HDMI 2.1. It starts with 512GB of storage. And its battery lasts <em>even longer</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These upgrades go a long way in making the MacBook Pro better and more futureproof for heavier creative tasks. Especially since it has a fan to cool its chip, allowing you to use content creation apps like the Adobe Creative Cloud suite for longer — the passively cooled Air starts off fast in these apps, but slows down considerably once its chip starts getting too hot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apple has two higher-end MacBook Pros: the 14- and 16-inch models running M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. They’re fantastic laptops with even more processing power than the base M4, plus upgrades like Thunderbolt 5 ports, but they start at $1,999 and $3,199, respectively. An M4 Pro model is a more futureproof option, but these are better fit for a working professional than a student.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\">Read our review of the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4.</a></h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The best modular laptops you can upgrade yourself</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Framework Laptop 13 (2025, AMD Ryzen AI 7 350)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257702_Framework_Laptop_13_AMD_2025_ADiBenedetto_0001.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Still the repairability champ with excellent, modular port selection</li><li>Faster CPU performance over both Intel and previous AMD models</li><li>High-res 3:2 aspect ratio screen is great for productivity</li><li>Thin, light, and an overall great package</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Radeon 860M iGPU performance is a little lacking</li><li>Trackpad still feels a little cheap</li><li>Screen is a little lacking in contrast and color quality</li><li>Less repairable laptops offer more for similar prices or less</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-amd-ai300/configuration/new\"> $899 at <strong>Framework</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300\">Framework Laptop 13</a> and 2-in-1 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel\">Laptop 12</a> are notebooks that can grow and change with you. They’re easily repairable, and even years down the road you should be able to upgrade the RAM, storage, ports, and the entire mainboard and processor. They even have optional DIY editions, requiring some easy assembly — which I assure you is a joyously nerdy way to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of your laptop. There’s nothing else like them, and if you or your kid are the tinkering types it’s a fun experience for running <em>either </em>Windows or Linux.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But you don’t have to be going for a computer engineering degree. Even a newcomer can appreciate how Framework allows you to choose modular ports and swap them out at will. You can go all USB-C like a MacBook Air, or you can get funky by mixing and matching USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI, SD / microSD card readers, and even an ethernet port.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You just have to be willing to pay extra for the Frameworks’ modularity, upgradeability, and easy repairability, as they cost more than equivalent or better-specced laptops from other manufacturers. The newer <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel\">Laptop 12</a> isn’t as good a choice for most people because of its price and older Intel chips, but its shock-resistant chassis and convertible tablet form factor make it even more uniquely appealing for younger kids.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Framework Laptop 12</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/257806_Framework_Laptop_12_ADiBenedetto_0008.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Easy repairs and potential upgrades</li><li>Fun design</li><li>Rubberized TPU edges make it more resilient for kids</li><li>Modular ports with internal “child locks”</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Not exactly cheap, especially with more RAM and storage</li><li>Aging processor, starts with 8GB of RAM</li><li>Chunky bezels</li><li>No Windows Hello unlocking</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://frame.work/products/laptop12-intel-13gen/configuration/new\"> $799 at <strong>Framework</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Read our reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300\">Framework Laptop 13</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel\">Laptop 12</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>A Windows laptop or tablet with amazing battery</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Microsoft Surface Laptop, 13-inch</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/257765_Microsoft_Surface_Laptop_13_2025_ADiBenedetto_0001.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Exquisite hardware that feels great to touch and use</li><li>Very good keyboard and one of the best mechanical trackpads</li><li>Battery can stretch to 1.5 days (with native Arm apps)</li><li>3:2 aspect ratio screen is ideal for productivity</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Webcam doesn’t support Windows Hello</li><li>Loss of magnetic charging port</li><li>Snapdragon X still has app and game compatibility issues that competing chips do not</li><li>Why have Home, Page Up, and Page Down keys instead of media controls?</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-laptop-13-inch/8mzbmmcjzqv3\"> $899.99 at <strong>Microsoft</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-surface-laptop-copilot-pc-13-touch-screen-snapdragon-x-plus-16gb-256b-ufs-latest-model-platinum/6623675.p?skuId=6623675\"> $899.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latest, lower-cost Surfaces from Microsoft are great machines with excellent battery life, great standby times when left asleep, and solid performance.

It’s a great Chromebook for older students, and a solid machine for just about anyone who wants a no-nonsense everyday computer.

It’s a package that’s well built and totally silent thanks to a fanless design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Arm-based MediaTek processor is what gives the Lenovo its zippy performance and battery stretching into a second day of use.

This is a very capable option for high school or college students who need to run Windows and prefer a big screen for easier multitasking. And its thinness makes it very portable for a 16-inch machine, making it less of a hassle to tote a large laptop around campus. Asus also makes a 14-inch version — we expect it to be similar, but we haven’t tested the smaller model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The downside of the Zenbook’s powerful chip and thin chassis is that it’s not the battery champ some of the other options here are. It’s still enough to get through an average day of classes, but it’s going to need a charge in the late afternoon if you have a lengthy sprint of back-to-back lectures or you’re cramming late into the night.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop\">Read our review of the Asus Zenbook S 16.</a></h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The best gaming laptop for (very responsible) students</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/rogzeyphg14_solo.webp?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Balanced performance, battery life, and portability</li><li>OLED display</li><li>Programmable LED strip on the lid</li><li>Great keyboard and smooth trackpad</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Gets a bit hot and loud under load</li><li>Soldered RAM</li><li>Thermally throttles its GPUs</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-270-16gb-lpddr5x-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white/6629420.p\"> <strike>$1799.99</strike> $1349.99 at <strong>Best Buy (5060)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/\"> $1799.99 at <strong>Asus</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white/6613954.p\"> <strike>$2399.99</strike> $2049.99 at <strong> Best Buy (5070 Ti)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Treating your kid to a gaming laptop may seem like you’re inviting them to slack off, but if you want to splurge on one device for both schoolwork and play you can’t go wrong with Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14. The G14 is as “normal” as gaming laptops get, with a design that doesn’t scream cringe-gamer too much (aside from some small ROG branding). Unlike many other gaming laptops, the Zephyrus has solid battery life that can get you through your day’s classes — assuming you save the gaming for when you plug in at the end of the day.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The $1,799.99 base model uses a capable AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor and discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, which is enough power to play just about any game, even the latest big-budget ones, albeit not at the highest settings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An important part of what makes the G14 special is how good <em>the rest</em> of the laptop is. It’s got a crisp and lovely 14-inch OLED with 2880 x 1800 resolution and 120Hz refresh, a great keyboard, and a very good trackpad. It offers a bunch of ports, and it doesn’t run overly loud or hot when tackling the basic productivity stuff.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You’d be spoiling your kid a bit (maybe a lot of bit) with a laptop like this, but you can meet their school needs while also treating them to the world of PC gaming.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop\">Read our buying guide featuring the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</a></h5>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"We’re in the heart of summer fun, but it’s already time for back-to-school planning, especially if that involves buying a new laptop.\nThe dizzying number of different laptops and configurations can feel overwhelming, especially if you want something that doesn’t cost too much but will still last a long time. My general guidelines are to first pick the operating system you need (based on personal preference or class requirements), and then get the best specs you can afford. If your school has specific requirements or recommendations, they are likely found on the school website. A quality laptop should also have a good screen, keyboard, and trackpad — and preferably enough ports and some decent speakers.\nUnless you’re buying a Chromebook, aim for an M4 processor (for Macs) or an Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7, an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series, or a Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor on a Windows machine, especially if you want your laptop to last at least four years. Aim for at least 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. If your budget allows for more RAM or storage then go for it, especially if neither is user-replaceable — it’ll help with performance and longevity. If you have to choose based on budget, prioritize RAM, since external storage is easily available.\nTaking much of that into account, here are our top picks among current laptops.\nThe best laptop for most students\nApple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEasily lasts a full day on battery\nExcellent choice for most people’s everyday needs\nNails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to be\n\nStill starts with just 256GB of storage\nStill has limited ports\nStill prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $849 at Amazon\n $999 $849 at Best Buy\n $999 $949 at B&H Photo\n\nUnless you’re going into a field involving lots of graphics rendering or video editing, a MacBook Air should be more than enough computer to last through the student years. The Air is our top laptop recommendation for most people, and that includes students — particularly students in high school or starting college. Nothing else offers quite the same balance of performance, build quality, and battery life as Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s a speedy little machine that can even handle some heftier content creation work. Its battery can easily get you through a packed day of classes. And it has the best trackpad around. The only major downside with an Air (as with all modern MacBooks) is that you can’t upgrade the storage or memory after you buy it.\nNow that MacBooks start with 16GB of RAM, even the base $999 13-inch model is excellent, if a little short on storage space at 256GB. So you may want to consider the $1,199 model with 512GB of storage. For the same price you can get the larger 15-inch model with roomier screen real estate and even better speakers, but then you’re once again starting with 256GB.\nApple MacBook Air 15 (2025, M4)\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEasily lasts a full day on battery\nExcellent choice for most people’s everyday needs\nNails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to be\nLouder speakers over its smaller counterpart\n\nStill starts with just 256GB of storage\nStill has limited ports\nStill prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 $1049 at Amazon\n $1199 $1049 at Best Buy\n $1199 $1069 at B&H Photo\n\nRead our review of the M4 MacBook Air.\nA note on older M-series Airs:\nThe original M1 MacBook Air can still be bought new from Walmart for $649 or less. Even at five years old, it remains a very good machine for those on tighter budgets, but it’s worth hunting for a deal on an M2 MacBook Air or newer if you can. That lingering M1 only has 8GB of RAM, and newer M2 and M3 versions have MagSafe chargers, better keyboards, and markedly better screens. You can often find one with 16GB of RAM for just a bit more than the M1, and it’ll be better for the long haul.\nThe best student laptop for serious content creation\nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4)\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEverything good about last year’s model but better \nAll the I/O of the pricier MacBook Pros\nMore RAM\nNew webcam is sharp and clear\nNano-texture display is a nice add-on\n\nDesk View webcam feature is low-res and overly distorted\nSpace black finish can still be a little smudgy\nApple’s price structure may still have you longing for M4 Pro / Max\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1432.75 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1599 $1549 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1799 $1609.66 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)\n\nMacBook Pros have long been a staple on college campuses for students in creative fields, and the latest base version is one of the best laptops Apple has cooked up in years. Apple’s base model 14-inch MacBook Pro is a step up from the MacBook Air, with the same M4 chip. Its starting price of $1,599 is a significant jump from a $999 Air, but you get better performance and a bunch of worthwhile upgrades. The Pro has more ports than the Air, including an SD card reader and HDMI 2.1. Its screen is a nicer Mini LED panel with higher resolution and faster refresh rate. It’s got more ports, including an SD card reader and HDMI 2.1. It starts with 512GB of storage. And its battery lasts even longer. \nThese upgrades go a long way in making the MacBook Pro better and more futureproof for heavier creative tasks. Especially since it has a fan to cool its chip, allowing you to use content creation apps like the Adobe Creative Cloud suite for longer — the passively cooled Air starts off fast in these apps, but slows down considerably once its chip starts getting too hot.\nApple has two higher-end MacBook Pros: the 14- and 16-inch models running M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. They’re fantastic laptops with even more processing power than the base M4, plus upgrades like Thunderbolt 5 ports, but they start at $1,999 and $3,199, respectively. An M4 Pro model is a more futureproof option, but these are better fit for a working professional than a student.\nRead our review of the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4.\nThe best modular laptops you can upgrade yourself\nFramework Laptop 13 (2025, AMD Ryzen AI 7 350)\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStill the repairability champ with excellent, modular port selection\nFaster CPU performance over both Intel and previous AMD models\nHigh-res 3:2 aspect ratio screen is great for productivity\nThin, light, and an overall great package\n\nRadeon 860M iGPU performance is a little lacking\nTrackpad still feels a little cheap\nScreen is a little lacking in contrast and color quality\nLess repairable laptops offer more for similar prices or less\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899 at Framework\n\nThe Framework Laptop 13 and 2-in-1 Laptop 12 are notebooks that can grow and change with you. They’re easily repairable, and even years down the road you should be able to upgrade the RAM, storage, ports, and the entire mainboard and processor. They even have optional DIY editions, requiring some easy assembly — which I assure you is a joyously nerdy way to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of your laptop. There’s nothing else like them, and if you or your kid are the tinkering types it’s a fun experience for running either Windows or Linux.\nBut you don’t have to be going for a computer engineering degree. Even a newcomer can appreciate how Framework allows you to choose modular ports and swap them out at will. You can go all USB-C like a MacBook Air, or you can get funky by mixing and matching USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI, SD / microSD card readers, and even an ethernet port. \nYou just have to be willing to pay extra for the Frameworks’ modularity, upgradeability, and easy repairability, as they cost more than equivalent or better-specced laptops from other manufacturers. The newer Laptop 12 isn’t as good a choice for most people because of its price and older Intel chips, but its shock-resistant chassis and convertible tablet form factor make it even more uniquely appealing for younger kids.\nFramework Laptop 12\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEasy repairs and potential upgrades\nFun design\nRubberized TPU edges make it more resilient for kids\nModular ports with internal “child locks”\n\nNot exactly cheap, especially with more RAM and storage\nAging processor, starts with 8GB of RAM\nChunky bezels\nNo Windows Hello unlocking\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 at Framework\n\nRead our reviews of the Framework Laptop 13 and Laptop 12.\nA Windows laptop or tablet with amazing battery\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop, 13-inch\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExquisite hardware that feels great to touch and use\nVery good keyboard and one of the best mechanical trackpads\nBattery can stretch to 1.5 days (with native Arm apps)\n3:2 aspect ratio screen is ideal for productivity\n\nWebcam doesn’t support Windows Hello\nLoss of magnetic charging port\nSnapdragon X still has app and game compatibility issues that competing chips do not\nWhy have Home, Page Up, and Page Down keys instead of media controls?\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 at Microsoft\n $899.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe latest, lower-cost Surfaces from Microsoft are great machines with excellent battery life, great standby times when left asleep, and solid performance. They’re Arm-based, which is what gives them that excellent battery life, but can lead to some app compatibility issues. Most common programs run fine, either natively or native-like via emulation. Just do your homework; if certain classes require specific apps, check to make sure they’ll run.\nThe 12-inch Surface Pro (starting at $799.99) and 13-inch Laptop (starting at $899.99) are well constructed, ultra-portable machines that feel very nice to use. Despite being the cheaper Windows laptops in this list, neither feels like a diminished experience (save for some odd design choices, like a lack of face unlock in the Laptop). \nYou can look at it as simply picking your preferred form factor: a traditional clamshell laptop or a convertible tablet with keyboard cover. The Laptop is the better buy, because the Surface Pro’s must-buy keyboard cover is an extra $150 (or $250 bundled with the stylus) — meaning its true starting price is around $850. \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 12-inch\nMicrosoft’s latest Surface Pro is smaller, with a new design and updated keyboard.

It’s a great Chromebook for older students, and a solid machine for just about anyone who wants a no-nonsense everyday computer. For $750 you get a fantastic touchscreen OLED display with deep contrast and vivid colors, a great keyboard, and marathon battery life. It’s a package that’s well built and totally silent thanks to a fanless design.\nThe Arm-based MediaTek processor is what gives the Lenovo its zippy performance and battery stretching into a second day of use. It can also lead to some small compatibility issues if you venture into using Linux apps (they need to be Arm compatible), but that’s unlikely to affect most users.\nThe Chromebook Plus 14 has some other small flaws, like lackluster 5Gbps data speeds on its USB ports and an only-okay trackpad, but it nails most everything else.

It’s one of the cheapest Chromebooks with the Plus designation, which means it meets a certain level of performance, battery life, and quality. Chromebook Plus laptops have better-than-average screens, and they should be able to last through a school day without needing a charge. \nThe CX34 normally costs $600 these days, but it sometimes sells for under $400. That’s the sweet spot, getting you excellent build quality, a nice screen, and a sleek design for an affordable price.\nThe CX34’s 1920 x 1080 / 250-nit display may feel a little cramped and dim compared to the 16:10 screens on the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 and Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, but it offers a sharp picture with minimal glare. It’s got a great keyboard that Asus claims to have tested as spill-resistant, giving a bit more peace of mind when entrusting it to a child. The Asus remains a go-to choice for something you can have younger students use that lasts some years.\nRead our review of the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34.\nA great higher-end Windows laptop with a big screen\nAsus Zenbook S 16\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIt’s gorgeous\nIncredibly thin and light for a 16-inch laptop\nGreat performance, especially the integrated graphics\n\nShorter battery life than major competitors\nStoryCube doesn’t work\nCouldn’t get a sense of how fast the NPU really is\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1399 at Asus\n $1799.99 at Best Buy\n\nSometimes bigger is better, and the Asus Zenbook S 16 is a total treat of a Windows thin-and-light laptop. It’s got AMD Strix Point processors that are powerful enough for even some light gaming, and the star of the show is its 2880 x 1800 16-inch OLED touchscreen capable of a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.\nThe Zenbook S 16 is one of the pricier options we have here, with a standard price of $1,799.99, but it sometimes goes on sale for as much as $500 off. This is a very capable option for high school or college students who need to run Windows and prefer a big screen for easier multitasking. And its thinness makes it very portable for a 16-inch machine, making it less of a hassle to tote a large laptop around campus. Asus also makes a 14-inch version — we expect it to be similar, but we haven’t tested the smaller model.\nThe downside of the Zenbook’s powerful chip and thin chassis is that it’s not the battery champ some of the other options here are. It’s still enough to get through an average day of classes, but it’s going to need a charge in the late afternoon if you have a lengthy sprint of back-to-back lectures or you’re cramming late into the night.\nRead our review of the Asus Zenbook S 16.\nThe best gaming laptop for (very responsible) students\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBalanced performance, battery life, and portability\nOLED display\nProgrammable LED strip on the lid\nGreat keyboard and smooth trackpad\n\nGets a bit hot and loud under load\nSoldered RAM\nThermally throttles its GPUs\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1349.99 at Best Buy (5060)\n $1799.99 at Asus\n $2399.99 $2049.99 at  Best Buy (5070 Ti)\n\nTreating your kid to a gaming laptop may seem like you’re inviting them to slack off, but if you want to splurge on one device for both schoolwork and play you can’t go wrong with Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14. The G14 is as “normal” as gaming laptops get, with a design that doesn’t scream cringe-gamer too much (aside from some small ROG branding). Unlike many other gaming laptops, the Zephyrus has solid battery life that can get you through your day’s classes — assuming you save the gaming for when you plug in at the end of the day.\nThe $1,799.99 base model uses a capable AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor and discrete Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, which is enough power to play just about any game, even the latest big-budget ones, albeit not at the highest settings.\nAn important part of what makes the G14 special is how good the rest of the laptop is. It’s got a crisp and lovely 14-inch OLED with 2880 x 1800 resolution and 120Hz refresh, a great keyboard, and a very good trackpad. It offers a bunch of ports, and it doesn’t run overly loud or hot when tackling the basic productivity stuff.\nYou’d be spoiling your kid a bit (maybe a lot of bit) with a laptop like this, but you can meet their school needs while also treating them to the world of PC gaming.\nRead our buying guide featuring the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.","summary":"We’re in the heart of summer fun, but it’s already time for back-to-school planning, especially if that involves buying a new laptop.
