Ring Home’s Premium plan is currently $19.99 per month or $199.99 per year. Arlo Plus is cheaper at $7.99 per month if you have just one camera, but for multiple cameras it’s $17.99 per month. Both Nest Aware and Nest Aware Plus support an unlimited number of devices in the same home.\nGoogle didn’t specify a reason for the increases, though there is a Gemini-powered camera intelligence feature for Nest Aware Plus currently available to a limited number of “select Home app users” through Google’s Public Preview beta program. The feature generates more descriptive captions of recorded camera events, such as ”the dog is digging in the garden.”","summary":"Google is raising the price of its Nest Aware and Nest Aware Plus subscriptions starting in August 2025.

Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control over access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.</p>\n\n<p>For most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera\">video doorbells</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23156554/smart-bulbs-switch-lighting-guide-how-to\">smart lighting</a>. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23749376/smart-home-explained-voice-assistant-tv-gadgets\">smart home</a>&nbsp;routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.</p>\n\n<p>Having a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see FAQ for more details), and it&#8217;s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door. Whether you want the best of the best, don&#8217;t want to replace your existing lock, are on a budget, or want a smart lock that doesn&#8217;t look like a smart lock, there are great options for every need.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-smart-lock\">Best smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kwikset Halo Select</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3419.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Excellent auto-unlock function</li><li>Choice of Wi-Fi or Matter-over-Thread</li><li>Great design</li><li>Discreet door sensor</li><li>Can be rekeyed</li><li></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Have to choose between Thread and Kwikset’s auto-unlock</li><li>No Home Key or biometric access</li><li>Touchscreen shows fingerprints</li><li>Prominent Kwikset branding</li><li></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJPTB7KG\"> $279 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Kwikset-HALO-Select-Touchscreen-Wi-Fi-and-Matter-Enabled-Smart-Lock-Deadbolt-in-Matte-Black-9800-WIFI-THRD-TSCR-514/332397488\"> $279 at <strong>Home Depot</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kwikset-Halo-Select-Satin-Nickel-Wifi-Single-Cylinder-Smartkey-Electronic-Deadbolt-with-Lighted-Keypad-Touchscreen/5015296445?\"> $279 at <strong>Lowes</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Connectivity:</em></strong><em> Wi-Fi, Thread / </em><strong><em>Access options:</em></strong><em> Key, keycode, app, voice / </em><strong><em>Auto-unlock:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Battery type:</em></strong><em> Four AA batteries / </em><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> Six to 12 months / </em><strong><em>Guest codes:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Security rating: </em></strong><em>ANSI Grade AAA / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant</em>, <em>Matter (including Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings)</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273662/kwikset-halo-select-new-smart-lock-matter-thread-wifi\">Kwikset Halo Select</a> (<a href=\"https://www.kwikset.com/products/detail/halo-select-touchscreen-wi-fi-and-matter-enabled-smart-lock\">$279.99</a>) is a good-looking, reliable smart lock with top-notch security ratings, broad smart home compatibility, and the best auto-unlock function I’ve tested to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I strongly believe a smart lock should look good on your door, and the Halo Select does exactly that, plus it can blend in with both traditional and contemporary door sets. (But I could do without the prominent Kwikset branding.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A3413-1.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Halo blends in nicely with a contemporary Kwikset door handle set. It&#039;s a shame about the prominent branding, though.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of the four entry methods — a keyway (which is <a href=\"https://www.kwikset.com/smartkey-security\">re-keyable</a>), a touchscreen keypad, app/smart home control, and auto-unlock by location — I liked the last one the best. It worked so well that I didn’t mind that it lacks a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My experience with automatic unlocking on other locks (which uses a combination of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock#:~:text=Smart%20door%20lock%20FAQs\">Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi</a> to determine your location) has been generally frustrating, but on the Halo Select, it’s been flawless. It unlocks just as I approach my porch, making coming home and opening the door a virtually hands-free experience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Select can also auto-lock based on your location, not just after a set amount of time as most locks offer. I also like the Halo Select’s LED lock indicator on the touchscreen, which tells you at a glance if the door is locked or unlocked.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Halo Select has built-in Wi-Fi and a Thread radio, but you have to pick one. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you set it up with Wi-Fi, you can use the Kwikset app and connect to Amazon Alexa and Google via the cloud. With Matter, you can connect to those platforms locally and also to Apple Home and others, but you won’t be able to use the Kwikset app after setup. so you lose the auto-unlock feature, among others.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Kwikset’s auto-unlock feature worked flawlessly in testing</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Matter-over-Thread does promise better battery life (I’ll need to test it for longer to determine this) and the ability to easily share the lock with other ecosystems. I set it up in Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings via Matter with no issues and could control it with all three via routines, automations, and voice commands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a shame to have to choose between using Matter and some of this lock’s best features, but this is a problem across Matter, not specific to Kwikset. Kwikset’s solution allows you to use its advanced features today while still having the future-proofing potential of Matter for tomorrow.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-full-review-of-the-kwikset-halo-select\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home-review/679903/kwikset-halo-select-smart-lock-review\">Read my full review of the Kwikset Halo Select</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"UODcx4\">Best budget smart(ish) lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Wyze Lock Bolt</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">This inexpensive smart door lock has a lightning-fast fingerprint reader plus an easy-to-use, backlit keypad.

It’s not sleek or stylish; it’s just a big hunk of black plastic (there’s also a satin nickel version). Out of the box, it doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems, but it does have an easy-to-use backlit keypad and a lightning-fast fingerprint reader. It’ll auto-lock if you want, and it’s half the price of most smart locks in this list.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24745153/8A0A6570.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Wyze lock has a huge rear housing but a nice slimline keypad, a fast fingerprint reader, and no Wi-Fi connection.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>In addition to the fingerprint reader and keypad, the Wyze Lock Bolt can be controlled over Bluetooth, and its range is very good. I could lock the door from my bedroom at the other end of the house using the Wyze app. That’s important, as there’s no way to lock the door on a schedule (although you can enable auto-lock).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignleft\"><blockquote><p>The Wyze doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>The Bolt doesn’t integrate with smart home platforms, but if you don’t need to control your lock with your voice or plan to add it to any smart home routines, you won’t miss those features. It also delivers up to a year of battery life on four AAs — I tested it for three months and it only lost 15 percent.</p>\n\n<p>But without Wi-Fi, I couldn’t check on it or control it when I was away from home, so turning on the auto-lock option is a must. If I wanted to let someone in while I was gone, I couldn’t unlock the door remotely, but I could generate an offline code in the Wyze app and share that. This uses similar technology to two-factor authentication codes and worked perfectly in my testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Since I tested the lock, Wyze has introduced an integration with its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22915876/wyze-video-doorbell-pro-review-budget-doorbell-camera\">Wyze Video Doorbell Pro </a>that lets you unlock the Bolt remotely when paired with the doorbell — but it doesn’t let you lock it remotely, which is odd.

It features a compact design and lightning-fast locking — even quicker than manually turning the lock — and it works over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24313084/smart-lock-home-preview-2025-matter-apple\">Matter over Thread</a>, the latter of which enables out-of-home control and notifications through any Matter-compatible smart home platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whereas most smart locks feature a big, bulky design, the Nuki Smart Lock boasts a minimalist style with a premium look and feel. Installation is straightforward — simply remove the thumbturn from your existing deadbolt, replace it with a blackplate, and snap the Nuki into place. Once it’s installed, you can get up and running without signing up for an account, which is a rare feature for a smart lock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Nuki app gives you access to multiple settings and customization options. In addition to standard features like key sharing with family members and enabling auto-lock and auto-unlock, it supports schedules, an activity log, and a convenient Night Mode, which can lock the door at a set time, disable auto-unlock, and enable auto-lock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you don’t have a Matter hub and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23823041/matter-thread-device-setup-smart-home-how-to\">Thread border router</a> — like a HomePod — Nuki offers a subscription service called <a href=\"https://nuki.io/en-us/products/nuki-premium?sku=nuki-premium-1745926736291\">Nuki Premium</a> ($5.90 per month). It adds features like remote access, lock activity notifications, and integration with rental platforms like Airbnb. Another possible upgrade is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7HLSQCG/\">optional keypad</a>. which supports both PIN codes and fingerprints, making it easy for friends, family, and guests to gain access without needing to download an app. Although the fingerprint reader works well, there is no backlight, making nighttime use tricky without a porch light. The current keypad doesn’t support Apple Home Key, though Nuki is planning to release one later this year with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/603957/uwb-hands-free-unlocking-schlage-aliro-apple-samsung-hands-on?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjo7DBhCrARIsACWauSlNtfG8MdSub86eRemLyhXGwTJDBlJocAHan9rW73u3L3JsAARDL_caAqYPEALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9k5E7D4IShVDiE_Pj3tXHaohe7KM\">ultra-wideband unlocking (UWB)</a> and NFC support.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nuki’s smart lock has a built-in battery that can last for months, and it only takes a few hours to fully recharge. While a non-removable battery raises concerns about longevity — smart locks generally use AA batteries — Nuki claims it should last 10 years.

It’s super easy to install, looks fine, and has all the same features (it uses the same app) — auto-lock, auto-unlock, app, and voice control. Add the Bluetooth keypad to get one-touch locking, key code, and fingerprint access.</p>\n\n<p>As with Nuki, the Approach replaces your thumb turn, so you can still use your current lock and key — making it a great option if you are renting and don’t want to annoy your landlord. While not as small as August, it has a nice, slim profile and blends in better than the rear housing of most smart locks.</p>\n\n<p>It comes in black or silver and took me less than five minutes to install. It uses four AA batteries and promises 12 months of battery life — a lot longer than the August. This is because there is no built-in Wi-Fi; instead, it uses an included plug-in bridge.</p>\n\n<p>The bridge adds out-of-home control and connection to smart home platforms, including Alexa and Google Home (unlike August, there’s no Apple Home support). This allows for voice control and adding it to smart home routines. Yale told me there’s an onboard <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24126764/yale-approach-smart-lock-price-release-date-specs#:~:text=Daviau%20also%20said,with%20Matter%20later.%E2%80%9D\">Thread radio</a> that will be activated to support Matter, but didn’t say when this would arrive.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25658974/8A0A1825.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Yale Bluetooth keypad with fingerprint access is slim and packed with function, but it&#039;s also very tall and clunky-looking.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The optional Bluetooth keypad lets you control the lock from the outside without using an app or key, and it worked promptly and reliably. There’s the option of a fingerprint version, and that was similarly a good experience — just touch and open. The keypad also allows you to lock the door when you leave by pressing the Yale logo button. </p>\n\n<p>The keys are a bit sensitive; I frequently get double inputs when pressing. But I liked the LED indicator that notifies you with green if your code was accepted or red if there’s an issue. This made it easy to know if the input worked, as the lock is very quiet — it’s hard to hear it locking or unlocking.</p>\n\n<p>My biggest disappointment is the look of the keypad. It’s big, wide, and black, with prominent white numbers that don’t disappear when not in use — it looks a bit like a toy keypad on your door.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CMVNGj\">Best fingerprint smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">This fingerprint lock is fast and reliable, and the keypad is a good backup option for visitors.

There’s an option with or without a keyway, with a touchscreen keypad or a physical keypad, or with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yale-Assure-Lock-Apple-Wi-Fi/dp/B0CBNF2M6F?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=___vg__p_23131505__t_w__r_https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock__d_D\">Apple Home Key</a>, but my favorite model is the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with a built-in fingerprint reader. It costs $279.99, and the built-in fingerprint reader is fast and efficient. I tested the touchscreen version, but Yale recently released <a href=\"https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch\">a keypad version</a>. Unless you really value the clean look of the touchscreen (which is blank when off), go with the keypad — it’s much easier to use.</p>\n\n<p>The Yale Assure 2 is a good-looking lock that works with every smart home platform with its swappable modules. Its slimline design (both front and back), wide smart home compatibility, easy-to-use app, and good selection of unlocking options — including fingerprint unlock — make it a great option for your front door.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/236819_Yale_Assure_Lock_2_JTuohy_0004.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Yale Touch’s fingerprint reader is fast and easy to use.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The lock supports Bluetooth out of the box and works with the Yale Access app and Apple Home app (which adds remote unlocking if you have an Apple Home hub). Along with a keycode, fingerprint reader, or key, you can also choose to use auto-unlocking. Auto-unlock is a decent alternative to fingerprint unlock, but I found I often had to wait at the door for a second or two before it worked. Still, it’s faster than fumbling through a purse for keys when your hands are full.</p>\n\n<p>Support for other platforms and remote unlocking comes through Yale’s ingenious swappable networking modules, which cost around $80 each. There’s a Wi-Fi module to add Alexa and Google Home integration and a <a href=\"https://www.yalehome.com/us/en/stories/news/z-wave-now-available-with-yale-assure-lock--2\">Z-Wave module</a> for compatibility with (some) SmartThings hubs, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22798830/ring-alarm-pro-review-smart-home-security-alexa\">Ring Alarm</a>, and other Z-Wave hubs. Yale promised support for Matter via a Matter-over-Thread module back in 2022, but this <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23891513/yale-assure-lock-2-touch-fingerprint-plus-homekey#:~:text=When%20we%20first,for%20early%20adopters.\">still hasn’t materialized</a>. They have announced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/638162/yale-smart-lock-with-matter-works-with-google-home\">a different lock that uses Thread</a>, but it doesn’t have a fingerprint reader. I plan to test this soon.</p>\n\n<p>I tested the <a href=\"https://shopyalehome.com/collections/accessories/products/yale-wi-fi-smart-module-for-assure\">Wi-Fi module</a> in the Assure 2 Touch, which worked well with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It allowed me to add the lock to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23312859/amazon-alexa-echo-routine-smart-speaker-how-to\">Alexa Routines</a>, lock and unlock it with my voice, and control it away from home. The downside is that control over Wi-Fi is considerably slower than over Bluetooth and drains the battery more quickly. Yale estimates up to a year on Bluetooth only, compared to six months over Wi-Fi; I got about four months.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"g2gz2L\">Read my review of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23367464/yale-assure-lock-2-touchscreen-keypad-wifi-review\">Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xMDzMI\">Best smart lock that works with Apple Home Key</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Schlage Encode Plus</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Encode Plus is a high-end, reliable smart lock that works with Apple Home and has Home Key compatibility.

It uses an NFC chip in the lock, and is fast, efficient, and secure. There are no apps to open, no buttons to press, and no need to unlock your phone (although you can add that step as an extra security layer). However, it does require an Apple device; it won’t work on Android. </p>\n\n<p>Home Key took a while to gain adoption, but there are now several options (and should soon be more as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23753915/matter-smart-lock-aqara-u100-apple-home-key#:~:text=Home%20Key%20will%20come%20to%20Matter%20locks%20in%20iOS17\">Apple has made it part of Matter</a>).

While it won’t be updated to support Matter, the Thread radio adds better battery life and a more stable connection to Apple Home than Bluetooth. I have had numerous connectivity issues in HomeKit with Bluetooth-only locks.</p>\n\n<p>To use Home Key, you need to have an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. Adding the lock to the Home app automatically adds the Home Key card to your Wallet, as well as that of anyone else you have added to your Apple Home. That’s much easier than getting household members to download a whole new app for the door lock. I should know — I try regularly. </p>\n\n<p>To allow someone not in your household to control the lock, you’ll have to give them a standard PIN, which you can do in the Apple Home app or the Schlage Encode app. If you like, you can set this lock up entirely in the Home app and never have to use the manufacturer’s app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"q0sOzQ\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22964521/schlage-smart-lock-review-encode-plus-apple-home-key-test\">Read our review of the Schlage Encode Plus</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"qBu5u5\">Best smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Level Lock Plus</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Level Lock Plus packs all the smarts and power into the deadbolt itself, leaving the rest of your lock looking like a normal lock.

It’s set to auto-lock by default, but you can enable passage mode directly on the lock if you don’t want it to stay locked all the time.</p>\n\n<p>It paired to Matter easily — I set it up in Apple Home and could add a code and Home Key all without even opening the Aqara app. Because it uses Thread, there’s no need for an Aqara hub. Thread also enables up to 10 months of battery life, according to Aqara.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25659184/8A0A1872.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The keyhole is hidden under the fingerprint reader.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>I love the idea of using smart locks on other doors in my home. I could see this working on a basement door, a home office, or any other room you like to keep people out of. However, I would like to see a way to permanently enable passage mode. Currently, you have to do it on the device, and it reverts to auto-lock after an undetermined period. This makes it somewhat useless for interior doors. It’s also very large and only comes in black or silver, so it likely wouldn’t blend in with your interior decor. A slimmer option, in more colorways, designed for inside use would be nice to see.</p>\n\n<p>The U300 is expensive at $230, but it&#8217;s similar to other outdoor-rated options (it’s IPX4-rated). The addition of Thread — a protocol that works over a mesh network — makes it easier to extend connectivity further to places like a shed or garage.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-smart-lock-that-s-also-a-video-doorbell\">Best smart lock that’s also a video doorbell</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Eufy FamiLock S3 Max</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3476.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Digital peephole is useful</li><li>Palm unlock is fast</li><li>Matter support</li><li>Rechargeable battery</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Very expensive</li><li>Nighttime video not great</li><li>HomeBase required for package detection</li><li>Doesn&#8217;t work with Matter when connected to HomeBase</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Recognition-Security-Electronic-Waterproof/dp/B0DTHMFMKP\"> $399.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&#038;xs=1&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Ffamilock-s3-max\"> $399.99 at <strong>Eufy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Connectivity:</em></strong><em> Wi-Fi or Eufy HomeBase / </em><strong><em>Access options:</em></strong><em> Key, palm unlock, keypad, app, voice / </em><strong><em>Auto-unlock:</em></strong><em> No / </em><strong><em>Battery type:</em></strong><em> Removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, AAA backup / </em><strong><em>Battery life:</em></strong><em> Five months / </em><strong><em>Guest codes:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Security rating:</em></strong><em> ANSI Grade 1 / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Matter (including Apple Home), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eufy’s new FamiLock S3 Max combines a smart lock and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera#zVdu3s\">video doorbell</a> in one device and features a digital peephole and a wave-to-unlock function. It also has a keyway and keypad and supports Matter-over-Wi-Fi, so it can work with all the major smart home platforms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My favorite of all these features is the video screen on the inside part of the lock, which shows a live feed of who is on the other side of the door. If you have a peephole or a window in your door, this might not be much use — and you can opt to get the lock without the screen for $50 less. But as a quick way to confirm who is at your door before opening it, it&#8217;s super handy.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A3494.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Palm unlock worked quickly and reliably, once we got the hang of it.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lock has another fairly unique feature: <a href=\"https://securityjournalamericas.com/palm-vein-scanning\">palm vein recognition technology</a>. This lets you wave your hand over it to unlock it, and is an alternative form of biometric access to the popular fingerprint reader.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Palm unlocking isn’t any faster or easier than using your fingerprint, though, and I found it harder to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it worked reliably. Both my kids also picked it up quickly, and my husband, who has trouble with fingerprint locks in general, really liked it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><span>The </span>main reason to buy this lock is for the video doorbell feature. The FamiLock’s 2K camera provides clear, crisp video during daylight hours and decent night vision, although my protruding door frame reflected the LEDs, causing the footage to blow out a bit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 180-degree diagonal field of view meant I could see top to bottom and all of one side (not the other side, though, due to the aforementioned door frame). But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A3480.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The rear of the lock is a screen that turns on when someone rings the doorbell.

Live view and recording pulled up promptly in the app, and the doorbell can alert you when it sees a person. For more advanced smart alerts, like packages and facial recognition, you need to connect it to a <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Fproducts%2Ft80301d1%3Fvariant%3D41846278357178\">Eufy HomeBase</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, connecting to the HomeBase means you currently can’t use the Matter integration, so you would lose Apple Home support (although Eufy says a firmware update is coming to fix that). Bear in mind, Matter only controls the lock, as cameras aren’t supported by the standard yet, so the benefits of using Matter are fairly limited. (<span>If you’re looking for a biometric Matter lock,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Fproducts%2Ft85f1111%3Fvariant%3D44170332307642\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eufy’s E30 is a good fingerprint lock that uses Matter-over-Thread</a></span>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Adding a video doorbell to a smart lock puts a lot of strain on the battery. While you can adjust several settings to help save power, Eufy says you’ll only get about five months of battery life from the lock’s giant 15,000mAh removable battery. Handily, four AAA backup batteries are tucked into the top to keep it functioning while you’re recharging the battery (which takes a while). I’ve been testing it for over a week, and the battery indicator hasn’t budged yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At $400, this is a very expensive lock, but it works well and provides dual functionality of a doorbell and door lock.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-facial-recognition-smart-lock\">Best facial recognition smart lock</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Lockly Visage</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3474.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Facial recognition is super fast</li><li>Home Key <em>and</em> a fingerprint reader</li><li>Compact design</li><li>Comes with two rechargeable batteries</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Keypad is hard to see, fiddly to use</li><li>Wired door sensor is ugly</li><li>No support for Matter</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&#038;xs=1&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Flockly.com%2Fproducts%2Flockly-visage-zeno-series\"> $349 at <strong>Lockly</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lockly-Recognition-Fingerprint-Deadbolt-Installation/dp/B0DRXF5NKL\"> $349 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Lockly-Visage-Facial-Recognition-Zeno-Matte-Black-Deadbolt-Wi-Fi-Smart-Lock-Home-Key-Fingerprint-Keypad-Siri-Alexa-Google-PGK728WRHKMB/329236400?g_store=&#038;source=shoppingads&#038;locale=en-US&#038;pla&#038;utm_source=google&#038;utm_medium=vantage&#038;utm_campaign=62027&#038;utm_content=64557&#038;mtc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D25H-Multi-NA-LOCKLY-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK717879001-62027-NBR-23664-NA-VNT-FY25_Q1_Q4_PINGENIEINCLOCKLY_D25H_RM_ES_AON_BAUOpportunity&#038;cm_mmc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D25H-Multi-NA-LOCKLY-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK717879001-62027-NBR-23664-NA-VNT-FY25_Q1_Q4_PINGENIEINCLOCKLY_D25H_RM_ES_AON_BAUOpportunity-22475771654--&#038;gad_source=1&#038;gad_campaignid=22469257614&#038;gbraid=0AAAAAolLu9-ymkt2Bchzoh_9RnRqeLRbi&#038;gclid=CjwKCAjw3f_BBhAPEiwAaA3K5CsPEoMdJjWlcO8dY9NSml86Nr7I-WsInXUWIQ6qkMgG3gyfDSpnAxoCpP4QAvD_BwE&#038;gclsrc=aw.ds\"> $349 at <strong>The Home Depot</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wi-Fi (2.4gHz) / <strong>Access options:</strong> Fingerprint, facial recognition, app, voice, keypad, Home Key, key / <strong>Auto-unlock:</strong> No / <strong>Battery type:</strong> 10,000mAh rechargeable</em> <em>/ <strong>Battery life:</strong> Eight months / <strong>Guest codes:</strong> Yes / <strong><em>Security rating:</em></strong><em> ANSI Grade 1</em></em></em> / <em><em><strong>Works with: </strong>Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home</em></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was very impressed with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025150/lockly-visage-facial-recognition-smart-lock-matter-home-key\">Lockly Visage</a>. The first facial recognition residential smart lock on the market, it also features a fingerprint reader, a keypad, a keyway, and Apple Home Key — that&#8217;s a lot of high-tech ways to unlock your door. And while it&#8217;s probably too much lock for most people, if you are a super smart home user or a major gadget nerd, you’ll love this lock.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3510.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The keypad is small and can be hard to see.

The only caveat is that I had to be approaching face-on, which in most cases I was, but the couple of times I approached from a slightly odd angle, it failed to unlock. In those cases, though, I had the option of using my fingerprint or Home Key.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also a touchscreen keypad, which is mainly useful for handing out codes to guests and visitors whose faces and fingers you don’t want to scan into your lock. The keypad is probably my least favorite part of the lock; it&#8217;s very small, which is good for the overall look, but fiddly to access. It&#8217;s also hard to see in bright light. But with all the other ways to unlock, this isn’t a deal-breaker.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Note that the Visage doesn’t take video or still images; its infrared camera is only used for facial recognition, data for which is stored on the device. Lockly does have <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flockly.com%2Fproducts%2Flockly-vision-zeno-series\">a video doorbell version for $429</a>, though that doesn’t have facial recognition.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/8A0A3457.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The wired plastic door sensor is a letdown, ugly and non-removable — it’s not a good look. &lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Surprisingly, despite all the tech packed into it, the lock is compact and stylish-looking and works with the redesigned Lockly Home app, which is now more straightforward and easier to use. The lock works over Wi-Fi and supports Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa, but there’s no support for Matter.</p>\n\n<p>Lockly claims eight months of battery life with its included rechargeable 10,000mAh battery. Uniquely, it comes with two batteries, so you can swap one and keep the lock online while charging the other. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At $350, the Lockly Visage is very expensive, but considering the tech packed into this lock, plus the two batteries, it’s not outrageous. Its solid build, broad smart home compatibility, and multiple very cool ways to control it make this a great lock.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6sNDLv\">Other smart locks to consider</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A3524.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy E30 is a fingerprint and keypad lock that supports both Matter-over-Thread and Wi-Fi&lt;/em&gt;.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24243714/eufy-smart-lock-e30-matter-thread-apple-home\">Eufy’s E30 smart lock</a> works with both Matter-over-Thread and Wi-Fi. It has a fingerprint reader, key, and keypad, and you can use the fingerprint access through the Eufy app while connecting it to platforms like Apple Home through Matter. Unlike the Kwikset Halo Select, you can use Wi-Fi and Thread simultaneously, which is unusual. I’ve not tested it long enough to determine if you still benefit from Thread’s better battery life. It’s cheaper than the Halo, has a fingerprint reader instead of auto-unlock, and promises 8 months of battery life. It can also integrate with a Eufy doorbell to control it from a live view. It has a nice compact design, but the rear housing is huge to fit 8 AA batteries.

I also don’t love the design of the Ultraloqs, while smaller on the exterior than most smart locks, they are squat and chunky looking, resembling a combination lock rather than door hardware.

Brandon Russell contributed to this post.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"A smart lock is an easy solution to some common problems. Locked yourself out? Need to let a friend in to water the plants? Your latchkey kid lost their key? Hands are full, and it’s raining cats and dogs? A smart lock solves all of these problems and more. \nOne of the best smart home upgrades you can make, a smart lock gives you remote control over access to your house from anywhere, plus easy, key-free ways to unlock and lock your door. Smart locks also remember everything that happened, so they can tell you when your door was unlocked, and sometimes who did it.\nFor most people, control and convenience are big enough selling points. However, smart locks also work nicely with other smart home devices, including video doorbells and smart lighting. My favorite way to integrate locks in my home is with an evening smart home routine, which locks the doors, dims the lights, and sets my thermostat to sleep mode. We have four exterior doors, so it saves me from walking around the house at night checking everything is secure.\nHaving a connected lock on your door is as secure as a standard lock, and sometimes more. Most smart locks have the same security ratings as their non-smart counterparts (see FAQ for more details), and it’s harder to physically pick a lock without a keyway. Plus, any smart lock is more secure than leaving a spare key under a flowerpot.\nI’ve been testing smart door locks for six years and have installed more than 30 for this guide alone. Here are my top picks for your front door. Whether you want the best of the best, don’t want to replace your existing lock, are on a budget, or want a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock, there are great options for every need.\nBest smart lock\nKwikset Halo Select\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent auto-unlock function\nChoice of Wi-Fi or Matter-over-Thread\nGreat design\nDiscreet door sensor\nCan be rekeyed\n\n\nHave to choose between Thread and Kwikset’s auto-unlock\nNo Home Key or biometric access\nTouchscreen shows fingerprints\nProminent Kwikset branding\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 at Amazon\n $279 at Home Depot\n $279 at Lowes\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Thread / Access options: Key, keycode, app, voice / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Six to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade AAA / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Matter (including Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings)\nThe Kwikset Halo Select ($279.99) is a good-looking, reliable smart lock with top-notch security ratings, broad smart home compatibility, and the best auto-unlock function I’ve tested to date.\nI strongly believe a smart lock should look good on your door, and the Halo Select does exactly that, plus it can blend in with both traditional and contemporary door sets. (But I could do without the prominent Kwikset branding.)\nOf the four entry methods — a keyway (which is re-keyable), a touchscreen keypad, app/smart home control, and auto-unlock by location — I liked the last one the best. It worked so well that I didn’t mind that it lacks a fingerprint reader or Apple Home Key.\nMy experience with automatic unlocking on other locks (which uses a combination of Bluetooth, GPS, and Wi-Fi to determine your location) has been generally frustrating, but on the Halo Select, it’s been flawless. It unlocks just as I approach my porch, making coming home and opening the door a virtually hands-free experience.\nThe Select can also auto-lock based on your location, not just after a set amount of time as most locks offer. I also like the Halo Select’s LED lock indicator on the touchscreen, which tells you at a glance if the door is locked or unlocked.\nThe Halo Select has built-in Wi-Fi and a Thread radio, but you have to pick one. \nIf you set it up with Wi-Fi, you can use the Kwikset app and connect to Amazon Alexa and Google via the cloud. With Matter, you can connect to those platforms locally and also to Apple Home and others, but you won’t be able to use the Kwikset app after setup. so you lose the auto-unlock feature, among others.\n\nKwikset’s auto-unlock feature worked flawlessly in testing\n\n\nMatter-over-Thread does promise better battery life (I’ll need to test it for longer to determine this) and the ability to easily share the lock with other ecosystems. I set it up in Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings via Matter with no issues and could control it with all three via routines, automations, and voice commands.\nIt’s a shame to have to choose between using Matter and some of this lock’s best features, but this is a problem across Matter, not specific to Kwikset. Kwikset’s solution allows you to use its advanced features today while still having the future-proofing potential of Matter for tomorrow.\nRead my full review of the Kwikset Halo Select.\nBest budget smart(ish) lock\nWyze Lock Bolt\nThis inexpensive smart door lock has a lightning-fast fingerprint reader plus an easy-to-use, backlit keypad. It’s Bluetooth-only (unless you also buy its compatible video doorbell to act as a Wi-Fi bridge), so the battery lasts over a year. At under $80, it’s the best budget lock we tested.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nInexpensive \nGood fingerprint reader\nOffline access codes\nLong battery life\n\n\nNo Wi-Fi \nNo smart home support\nLarge rear housing\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.98 $62.86 at Amazon\n $79.98 $62.86 at Wyze\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.0  / Access options: Fingerprint, keypad, app / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries  / Battery life: One year / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA Grade 3 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: N/A\nThe Wyze Lock Bolt is a good choice if you want something inexpensive and useful and don’t care about smart home integration — or prefer a lock without it. It’s not sleek or stylish; it’s just a big hunk of black plastic (there’s also a satin nickel version). Out of the box, it doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems, but it does have an easy-to-use backlit keypad and a lightning-fast fingerprint reader. It’ll auto-lock if you want, and it’s half the price of most smart locks in this list. \nIn addition to the fingerprint reader and keypad, the Wyze Lock Bolt can be controlled over Bluetooth, and its range is very good. I could lock the door from my bedroom at the other end of the house using the Wyze app. That’s important, as there’s no way to lock the door on a schedule (although you can enable auto-lock).\n\nThe Wyze doesn’t connect to Wi-Fi or integrate with any smart home systems \n\n\nThe Bolt doesn’t integrate with smart home platforms, but if you don’t need to control your lock with your voice or plan to add it to any smart home routines, you won’t miss those features. It also delivers up to a year of battery life on four AAs — I tested it for three months and it only lost 15 percent.\nBut without Wi-Fi, I couldn’t check on it or control it when I was away from home, so turning on the auto-lock option is a must. If I wanted to let someone in while I was gone, I couldn’t unlock the door remotely, but I could generate an offline code in the Wyze app and share that. This uses similar technology to two-factor authentication codes and worked perfectly in my testing. \nSince I tested the lock, Wyze has introduced an integration with its Wyze Video Doorbell Pro that lets you unlock the Bolt remotely when paired with the doorbell — but it doesn’t let you lock it remotely, which is odd. Of course, if you enable auto-lock, this is less of an issue.\nBest retrofit smart lock\nNuki Smart Lock\nNuki Smart Lock\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLightning fast\nNice, compact design\nSimple to install\nSupports Wi-Fi and Matter over Thread\nNo account required\nBroad smart home compatibility\n\nSubscription required for remote access (without Matter)\nNo Apple Home Key\nProprietary charging cable\nNo door sensor included\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159 at Amazon \n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter-over-Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, fingerprint and keypad (sold separately) /  Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Non-removable, rechargeable / Battery life: Up to 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Nuki Smart Lock is the most advanced retrofit smart lock we’ve tested, and a worthy replacement for our previous pick, the August Wi-Fi Smart Lock. It features a compact design and lightning-fast locking — even quicker than manually turning the lock — and it works over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Matter over Thread, the latter of which enables out-of-home control and notifications through any Matter-compatible smart home platform.\nWhereas most smart locks feature a big, bulky design, the Nuki Smart Lock boasts a minimalist style with a premium look and feel. Installation is straightforward — simply remove the thumbturn from your existing deadbolt, replace it with a blackplate, and snap the Nuki into place. Once it’s installed, you can get up and running without signing up for an account, which is a rare feature for a smart lock.\nThe Nuki app gives you access to multiple settings and customization options. In addition to standard features like key sharing with family members and enabling auto-lock and auto-unlock, it supports schedules, an activity log, and a convenient Night Mode, which can lock the door at a set time, disable auto-unlock, and enable auto-lock.\nIf you don’t have a Matter hub and a Thread border router — like a HomePod — Nuki offers a subscription service called Nuki Premium ($5.90 per month). It adds features like remote access, lock activity notifications, and integration with rental platforms like Airbnb. Another possible upgrade is the optional keypad. which supports both PIN codes and fingerprints, making it easy for friends, family, and guests to gain access without needing to download an app. Although the fingerprint reader works well, there is no backlight, making nighttime use tricky without a porch light. The current keypad doesn’t support Apple Home Key, though Nuki is planning to release one later this year with ultra-wideband unlocking (UWB) and NFC support.\nNuki’s smart lock has a built-in battery that can last for months, and it only takes a few hours to fully recharge. While a non-removable battery raises concerns about longevity — smart locks generally use AA batteries — Nuki claims it should last 10 years. After that, the company says a replacement plan will be offered.\nRead our review of the Nuki Smart Lock.\nBest smart lock for renters\nYale Approach Lock with Wi-Fi\nThis slimline, easy-to-install, inexpensive retrofit lock is a simple solution with a longer battery life than the August. It requires a plug-in bridge for out-of-home control (for now) and doesn’t work with Apple Home. The optional keypad adds to the cost but also to the convenience. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEasy install\nOption of fingerprint keypad\nA year of battery life\n\nRequires Wi-Fi bridge\nKeypad is big and ugly\nNo support for Matter\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 at Amazon\n $229.99 at Yale (with fingerprint keypad)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (with plug-in module) / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad and fingerprint reader sold separately / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA alkaline batteries / Battery life: 12 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nStarting at $130, the Yale Approach is a more affordable alternative to the August. It’s super easy to install, looks fine, and has all the same features (it uses the same app) — auto-lock, auto-unlock, app, and voice control. Add the Bluetooth keypad to get one-touch locking, key code, and fingerprint access.\nAs with Nuki, the Approach replaces your thumb turn, so you can still use your current lock and key — making it a great option if you are renting and don’t want to annoy your landlord. While not as small as August, it has a nice, slim profile and blends in better than the rear housing of most smart locks.\nIt comes in black or silver and took me less than five minutes to install. It uses four AA batteries and promises 12 months of battery life — a lot longer than the August. This is because there is no built-in Wi-Fi; instead, it uses an included plug-in bridge.\nThe bridge adds out-of-home control and connection to smart home platforms, including Alexa and Google Home (unlike August, there’s no Apple Home support). This allows for voice control and adding it to smart home routines. Yale told me there’s an onboard Thread radio that will be activated to support Matter, but didn’t say when this would arrive.\nThe optional Bluetooth keypad lets you control the lock from the outside without using an app or key, and it worked promptly and reliably. There’s the option of a fingerprint version, and that was similarly a good experience — just touch and open. The keypad also allows you to lock the door when you leave by pressing the Yale logo button. \nThe keys are a bit sensitive; I frequently get double inputs when pressing. But I liked the LED indicator that notifies you with green if your code was accepted or red if there’s an issue. This made it easy to know if the input worked, as the lock is very quiet — it’s hard to hear it locking or unlocking.\nMy biggest disappointment is the look of the keypad. It’s big, wide, and black, with prominent white numbers that don’t disappear when not in use — it looks a bit like a toy keypad on your door.\nBest fingerprint smart lock\nYale Assure Lock 2 Touch\nThis fingerprint lock is fast and reliable, and the keypad is a good backup option for visitors. It works with Apple Home and can be upgraded to support Wi-Fi — which you’ll need for remote unlocking, Android phones, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home support. Auto-unlock can open the door as you approach, and you can also use a key — if you just can’t let go.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFast fingerprint reader\nNice, compact design\nWorks with Apple Home\nCompatible with Wi-Fi and Z-Wave\n\nTouchscreen isn’t intuitive\nAuto-unlock can be slow / unreliable\nNo Matter support\nProminent Yale branding\nAdditional connectivity options cost extra\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279.99 $220.98 at Amazon\n $279.99 at The Home Depot\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth (can add Wi-Fi, Z-Wave) / Access options: Key, keypad, fingerprint reader, app, voice / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Six months to a year / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI/BHMA Grade 2 / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Yale Assure 2 line — previously my top pick — has something for everyone. There’s an option with or without a keyway, with a touchscreen keypad or a physical keypad, or with Apple Home Key, but my favorite model is the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch with a built-in fingerprint reader. It costs $279.99, and the built-in fingerprint reader is fast and efficient. I tested the touchscreen version, but Yale recently released a keypad version. Unless you really value the clean look of the touchscreen (which is blank when off), go with the keypad — it’s much easier to use.\nThe Yale Assure 2 is a good-looking lock that works with every smart home platform with its swappable modules. Its slimline design (both front and back), wide smart home compatibility, easy-to-use app, and good selection of unlocking options — including fingerprint unlock — make it a great option for your front door. \nThe lock supports Bluetooth out of the box and works with the Yale Access app and Apple Home app (which adds remote unlocking if you have an Apple Home hub). Along with a keycode, fingerprint reader, or key, you can also choose to use auto-unlocking. Auto-unlock is a decent alternative to fingerprint unlock, but I found I often had to wait at the door for a second or two before it worked. Still, it’s faster than fumbling through a purse for keys when your hands are full.\nSupport for other platforms and remote unlocking comes through Yale’s ingenious swappable networking modules, which cost around $80 each. There’s a Wi-Fi module to add Alexa and Google Home integration and a Z-Wave module for compatibility with (some) SmartThings hubs, Ring Alarm, and other Z-Wave hubs. Yale promised support for Matter via a Matter-over-Thread module back in 2022, but this still hasn’t materialized. They have announced a different lock that uses Thread, but it doesn’t have a fingerprint reader. I plan to test this soon.\nI tested the Wi-Fi module in the Assure 2 Touch, which worked well with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It allowed me to add the lock to Alexa Routines, lock and unlock it with my voice, and control it away from home. The downside is that control over Wi-Fi is considerably slower than over Bluetooth and drains the battery more quickly. Yale estimates up to a year on Bluetooth only, compared to six months over Wi-Fi; I got about four months.\nRead my review of the Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch.\nBest smart lock that works with Apple Home Key\nSchlage Encode Plus\nThe Encode Plus is a high-end, reliable smart lock that works with Apple Home and has Home Key compatibility. It also has a Thread radio on board, which helps with connectivity and battery life.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSupport for Apple Home and Home Key\nWorks over Thread\nEasy-to-use keypad\nNice design options that may match your hardware\n\nExpensive\nQuite loud\nNo Matter support\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $259 at Amazon\n $329 $259 at The Home Depot\n $297.09 at Build\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi or Thread / Access options: Key, keypad, app, voice, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: Up to six months / Security Grade: ANSI Grade 1 / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Apple Home (Home Key), Amazon Alexa, Ring, and Google Home\nApple Home Key lets you use your iPhone or Apple Watch to tap to unlock your door in much the same way as you tap to pay. It uses an NFC chip in the lock, and is fast, efficient, and secure. There are no apps to open, no buttons to press, and no need to unlock your phone (although you can add that step as an extra security layer). However, it does require an Apple device; it won’t work on Android. \nHome Key took a while to gain adoption, but there are now several options (and should soon be more as Apple has made it part of Matter). The Schlage Encode Plus is still the best option — if one of the most expensive — as it has a built-in keypad and works over Thread. \nThe keypad is useful for giving access to people with whom you can’t share a Home Key (sharing is quite limited), and Thread makes for a rock-solid connection. While it won’t be updated to support Matter, the Thread radio adds better battery life and a more stable connection to Apple Home than Bluetooth. I have had numerous connectivity issues in HomeKit with Bluetooth-only locks.\nTo use Home Key, you need to have an Apple Home Hub, such as an Apple TV or HomePod. Adding the lock to the Home app automatically adds the Home Key card to your Wallet, as well as that of anyone else you have added to your Apple Home. That’s much easier than getting household members to download a whole new app for the door lock. I should know — I try regularly. \nTo allow someone not in your household to control the lock, you’ll have to give them a standard PIN, which you can do in the Apple Home app or the Schlage Encode app. If you like, you can set this lock up entirely in the Home app and never have to use the manufacturer’s app. \nRead our review of the Schlage Encode Plus.\nBest smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock\nLevel Lock Plus\nThe Level Lock Plus packs all the smarts and power into the deadbolt itself, leaving the rest of your lock looking like a normal lock. It works with Apple’s Home Key, auto-unlocks, has the option of a separate keypad, and supports Matter-over-Thread. \n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nNo branding\nSmall and unobtrusive\nSupports Home Key\nWorks over Thread\nBroad smart home compatibility through Matter\n\nExpensive\nKeypad costs extra\nAuto-unlock can be unreliable\nNot ideal for older doors\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329 $284.99 at Amazon\n $329 at Level\n $349 at Level (with Wi-Fi)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth, Thread, Wi-Fi with bridge / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad (sold separately), Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: Yes / Battery type: One CR2 battery / Battery life: One year / Guest codes: Yes / Security Grade: ANSI/BHMA: Grade 1 / Works with: Matter, Apple Home, Ring \nWant a smart lock that doesn’t look like a smart lock? Level packs all the technology inside the deadbolt — including the single CR2 battery that gets up to a year of battery life.\nThe Level Lock Plus works with Apple’s Home Key and recently started supporting Matter over Thread. You can also control it with a key, auto-unlock, touch-to-unlock, the app, and smart home integrations. If you don’t use an iPhone or have family members who don’t, you’ll want to get the Bluetooth keypad (from $79) to give you another option for access. The lock also comes with two NFC cards you can hand out.\nThe Level Lock Plus replaces the whole lock, deadbolt and all, but still looks like a traditional door lock — both in front and behind the door. There is no branding at all — this is the only smart lock I’ve tested that isn’t a tiny advertisement on my front door. There’s also the option of the Level Bolt, which only replaces the deadbolt of your existing lock. This has all the same features, bar Home Key and touch-to-unlock, and it costs significantly less. \nLevel locks work over Bluetooth out of the box and can connect to an Apple Home hub for out-of-home control. If you don’t have a HomePod or Apple TV, get the Level Lock Plus with Wi-Fi, which comes with a Connect Wi-Fi bridge. Or you can connect it to Matter for smart home and out-of-home control. You’ll need a Matter controller, which can be a HomePod or Amazon Echo smart speaker, among other options (See FAQ).\nThe Level lock also has auto-unlocking and touch-to-unlock, though with some quirks: it’s one or the other, not both. And neither works unless you leave the geofence area and come back. So if you leave the house, lock the door, get in your car, remember you forgot something, and go back to your door, it won’t unlock automatically. This is why I prefer Home Key or a keypad for unlocking.\nBased on my testing of the lock on three different doors, it is worth noting that the full replacement Level locks don’t work well with older doors. I would only consider installing this if your door lines up perfectly with the strike plate.\nLevel locks are very expensive; the Plus costs $329 ($349 for the Wi-Fi version). But it’s the way to go for an invisible smart lock that works well. \nRead my review of the Level Lock Plus.\nBest smart lever lock\nAqara Smart Lock U300\nThe first single-borehole smart lock to work with Apple Home Key, the U300 can also be unlocked with a fingerprint, making it an easy, smart addition for shed, garage, or home office doors. It works over Thread and is Matter compatible, with up to a 10-month battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229.99 $179.99 at Amazon\n\nConnectivity: Thread / Access options: Key, app, voice, keypad, NFC tag, Apple Home Key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Four AA batteries / Battery life: 10 months / Guest codes: Yes / Works with: Matter, Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings\nThe Aqara U300 is a lever-style smart lock; it replaces a knob or lever lock on a door with a single borehole rather than a door with a deadbolt lock with two holes. This type of lock is traditionally found on interior doors, pedestrian doors into garages, or side doors.\nThere are options for smart lever locks from Yale, Schlage, and Lockly, but the U300 is the only one with Home Key compatibility and a built-in fingerprint reader. It also works over Thread and supports Matter.\nI installed it on my garage door, and it works like a charm. The fingerprint reader is right where you put your thumb to open the door, so I barely notice it unlocking as I walk in. It also has a keypad, and I can use my iPhone or Apple Watch for Home Key. It’s set to auto-lock by default, but you can enable passage mode directly on the lock if you don’t want it to stay locked all the time.\nIt paired to Matter easily — I set it up in Apple Home and could add a code and Home Key all without even opening the Aqara app. Because it uses Thread, there’s no need for an Aqara hub. Thread also enables up to 10 months of battery life, according to Aqara.\nI love the idea of using smart locks on other doors in my home. I could see this working on a basement door, a home office, or any other room you like to keep people out of. However, I would like to see a way to permanently enable passage mode. Currently, you have to do it on the device, and it reverts to auto-lock after an undetermined period. This makes it somewhat useless for interior doors. It’s also very large and only comes in black or silver, so it likely wouldn’t blend in with your interior decor. A slimmer option, in more colorways, designed for inside use would be nice to see.\nThe U300 is expensive at $230, but it’s similar to other outdoor-rated options (it’s IPX4-rated). The addition of Thread — a protocol that works over a mesh network — makes it easier to extend connectivity further to places like a shed or garage.\nBest smart lock that’s also a video doorbell\nEufy FamiLock S3 Max\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nDigital peephole is useful\nPalm unlock is fast\nMatter support\nRechargeable battery\n\nVery expensive\nNighttime video not great\nHomeBase required for package detection\nDoesn’t work with Matter when connected to HomeBase\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 at Amazon\n $399.99 at Eufy\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi or Eufy HomeBase / Access options: Key, palm unlock, keypad, app, voice / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: Removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery, AAA backup / Battery life: Five months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Matter (including Apple Home), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home\nEufy’s new FamiLock S3 Max combines a smart lock and video doorbell in one device and features a digital peephole and a wave-to-unlock function. It also has a keyway and keypad and supports Matter-over-Wi-Fi, so it can work with all the major smart home platforms.\nMy favorite of all these features is the video screen on the inside part of the lock, which shows a live feed of who is on the other side of the door. If you have a peephole or a window in your door, this might not be much use — and you can opt to get the lock without the screen for $50 less. But as a quick way to confirm who is at your door before opening it, it’s super handy.\nThe lock has another fairly unique feature: palm vein recognition technology. This lets you wave your hand over it to unlock it, and is an alternative form of biometric access to the popular fingerprint reader.\nPalm unlocking isn’t any faster or easier than using your fingerprint, though, and I found it harder to get used to. But once I got the hang of it, it worked reliably. Both my kids also picked it up quickly, and my husband, who has trouble with fingerprint locks in general, really liked it.\nThe main reason to buy this lock is for the video doorbell feature. The FamiLock’s 2K camera provides clear, crisp video during daylight hours and decent night vision, although my protruding door frame reflected the LEDs, causing the footage to blow out a bit.\nThe 180-degree diagonal field of view meant I could see top to bottom and all of one side (not the other side, though, due to the aforementioned door frame). But packages and people were clearly visible, which is most of what you want to see with a doorbell camera.\nThere’s no fee for viewing recorded footage of visitors in the Eufy app, and videos are stored locally on the device. Live view and recording pulled up promptly in the app, and the doorbell can alert you when it sees a person. For more advanced smart alerts, like packages and facial recognition, you need to connect it to a Eufy HomeBase.\nHowever, connecting to the HomeBase means you currently can’t use the Matter integration, so you would lose Apple Home support (although Eufy says a firmware update is coming to fix that). Bear in mind, Matter only controls the lock, as cameras aren’t supported by the standard yet, so the benefits of using Matter are fairly limited. (If you’re looking for a biometric Matter lock, Eufy’s E30 is a good fingerprint lock that uses Matter-over-Thread.)\nAdding a video doorbell to a smart lock puts a lot of strain on the battery. While you can adjust several settings to help save power, Eufy says you’ll only get about five months of battery life from the lock’s giant 15,000mAh removable battery. Handily, four AAA backup batteries are tucked into the top to keep it functioning while you’re recharging the battery (which takes a while). I’ve been testing it for over a week, and the battery indicator hasn’t budged yet.\nAt $400, this is a very expensive lock, but it works well and provides dual functionality of a doorbell and door lock.\nBest facial recognition smart lock\nLockly Visage\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFacial recognition is super fast\nHome Key and a fingerprint reader\nCompact design\nComes with two rechargeable batteries\n\nKeypad is hard to see, fiddly to use\nWired door sensor is ugly\nNo support for Matter\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 at Lockly\n $349 at Amazon\n $349 at The Home Depot\n\nConnectivity: Wi-Fi (2.4gHz) / Access options: Fingerprint, facial recognition, app, voice, keypad, Home Key, key / Auto-unlock: No / Battery type: 10,000mAh rechargeable / Battery life: Eight months / Guest codes: Yes / Security rating: ANSI Grade 1 / Works with: Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nI was very impressed with the Lockly Visage. The first facial recognition residential smart lock on the market, it also features a fingerprint reader, a keypad, a keyway, and Apple Home Key — that’s a lot of high-tech ways to unlock your door. And while it’s probably too much lock for most people, if you are a super smart home user or a major gadget nerd, you’ll love this lock.\nI was skeptical about the facial unlocking at first, but it worked really well, opening a second or two before I put my hand on the handle. The only caveat is that I had to be approaching face-on, which in most cases I was, but the couple of times I approached from a slightly odd angle, it failed to unlock. In those cases, though, I had the option of using my fingerprint or Home Key.\nThere’s also a touchscreen keypad, which is mainly useful for handing out codes to guests and visitors whose faces and fingers you don’t want to scan into your lock. The keypad is probably my least favorite part of the lock; it’s very small, which is good for the overall look, but fiddly to access. It’s also hard to see in bright light. But with all the other ways to unlock, this isn’t a deal-breaker.\nNote that the Visage doesn’t take video or still images; its infrared camera is only used for facial recognition, data for which is stored on the device. Lockly does have a video doorbell version for $429, though that doesn’t have facial recognition.\nSurprisingly, despite all the tech packed into it, the lock is compact and stylish-looking and works with the redesigned Lockly Home app, which is now more straightforward and easier to use. The lock works over Wi-Fi and supports Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa, but there’s no support for Matter.\nLockly claims eight months of battery life with its included rechargeable 10,000mAh battery. Uniquely, it comes with two batteries, so you can swap one and keep the lock online while charging the other. \nAt $350, the Lockly Visage is very expensive, but considering the tech packed into this lock, plus the two batteries, it’s not outrageous. Its solid build, broad smart home compatibility, and multiple very cool ways to control it make this a great lock.\nOther smart locks to consider\nEufy’s E30 smart lock works with both Matter-over-Thread and Wi-Fi. It has a fingerprint reader, key, and keypad, and you can use the fingerprint access through the Eufy app while connecting it to platforms like Apple Home through Matter. Unlike the Kwikset Halo Select, you can use Wi-Fi and Thread simultaneously, which is unusual. I’ve not tested it long enough to determine if you still benefit from Thread’s better battery life. It’s cheaper than the Halo, has a fingerprint reader instead of auto-unlock, and promises 8 months of battery life. It can also integrate with a Eufy doorbell to control it from a live view. It has a nice compact design, but the rear housing is huge to fit 8 AA batteries. The lock is loud in operation, and the fingerprint reader was finicky; it also has the lowest ANSI/BHMA rating.\nU-tec’s Bolt Fingerprint Matter works over Thread and can be set up directly in your smart home platform of choice — no need to use U-tec’s U Home. But if you want to use its built-in fingerprint reader, you’ll need to download the app. And if you don’t use it, then it’s kind of a waste of space, so the whole “you only need one app” feature falls flat. I also don’t love the design of the Ultraloqs, while smaller on the exterior than most smart locks, they are squat and chunky looking, resembling a combination lock rather than door hardware. It also uses eight batteries, which is an absurd amount, and is very noisy.\nIf you’re an Amazon Alexa Ring household, the Schlage Encode Wifi lock is a good option; it integrates with the Ring app, so you can lock and unlock it while viewing a live feed from your Ring doorbell. Its design will also match a Schlage door set, which is important for some people. There’s no door-sensing or auto-unlock option, but you have three reliable ways to get in: a key, a PIN, and the app. It also lasts at least six months on one set of four AAs.\nIf you want Home Key but the Schlage is too expensive or not your style, the Aqara U50 is a good, inexpensive alternative that’s less than half the price of the Schlage. It doesn’t have as good a build quality, and the keypad is a bit finicky, but it works with Apple Home and Home Key out of the box. (You‘ll need an Aqara hub for any other smart home integrations, including Matter.) It also pairs with Aqara’s G4 video doorbell to unlock the door while viewing video from the live feed. (Aqara has a doorbell that’s also a hub coming soon).\nThe Aqara Smart Lock U100 is a Matter-compatible smart lock that also works with Apple HomeKit and Home Key. A full replacement deadlock that can be unlocked by key, keypad, NFC key fob, fingerprint, voice control, through an app, or with Apple Home Key. It’s a good lock, but its smart home integrations are complicated, and there are now better options.\nThe Yale Assure SL with Matter Module is a Matter-over-Thread deadbolt smart lock. It’s simple, with a clean design and a touchscreen keypad for entry. There’s no keyway, fingerprint reader, or Apple Home Key, but in terms of simplicity, reliability, and future-proofing, it’s a good option. It’s one of the few locks you can connect directly to your smart home platform of choice without needing to download the manufacturer’s app — the Assure SL doesn’t even work with Yale’s app.\nThe SwitchBot Lock Pro is an all-around upgrade to one of my previous favorite locks, the SwitchBot lock (which is now discontinued). It’s a great solution if you have an unusual lock, as it can work on almost any door; it has higher-quality materials than the original, but now requires you to replace the rear of your lock (as most retrofit locks do). It does support Matter through a bridge, but for $200, I would still opt for August.\nThe Kwikset Halo Touch is a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi fingerprint lock with a traditional keyway. As there’s no keypad, it looks more like a standard lock with the bonus of easy access. This is more limiting when it comes to sharing access to your door, but it’s a good solution for anyone who wants a simple key-free way into their home and knows they won’t need to share lots of digital keys.\nOther smart locks I tested\nThe Aqara U200 is $270. That’s a lot for a retrofit lock — even with support for Thread, Matter, and Home Key. It has a keypad/fingerprint reader included; most retrofit locks charge extra for one. The keypad enables Apple Home Key, and this is the only retrofit lock that works with it. If that’s something you want, then this is the only option for now. Otherwise, you can get all the same functionality with the Yale Approach — plus auto-unlock — for $40 less.\nU-tec’s Ultraloq Bolt Fingerprint with Wi-Fi ($199 to $249) is the newest version of an earlier pick for best lock, the U-Bolt Pro with Wi-Fi. This version adds support for Apple Home (that’s the $249 one), but not Home Key, and a slight redesign — you no longer have to pop half the lock collar off to get to the keyhole, which is a good upgrade. It still has a fingerprint reader and auto-unlock.\nThe Bosma Aegis is an inexpensive retrofit lock that works well and costs just $60. It is remarkably similar to the August Wifi lock in terms of function and installation, but not build quality (it’s very plasticky). It also has a Bluetooth keypad option (with a fingerprint reader). But it is giant. Like, hulking huge. It’s also very loud and requires a separate bridge.\nThe Lockly Vision Elite is a smart lock with a video doorbell. It’s very expensive, and it’s not a great video doorbell. Motion detection is spotty, and the camera lacks people or package detection. It works with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, but not Apple Home or Matter.\nThe Eufy Smart Lock Touch is a very good lock in terms of function — it has an easy-to-use fingerprint reader, a nice big touchscreen keypad, the option of a key, and Wi-Fi built in. But it is just too big and techie-looking for most people’s front doors. I do like the removable 10,000mAh battery, which went eight months before needing to recharge (with a USB-A cable). But that’s also why this lock is so big.\nThe Eufy Video Smart Lock is similarly huge and very expensive; it requires a bridge to connect to Wi-Fi, and the Eufy FamiLock offers way more features for just $50 more.\nWhat’s coming next\nThe Tapo DL100 is a $70 smart lock with built-in Wi-Fi, a keypad, and a physical key, plus access via the Tapo mobile app and smart home integrations. It’s cheaper than my budget pick, the Wyze Bolt, and includes Wi-Fi for remote access, but you don’t get a fingerprint reader. It works with Tapo’s excellent video doorbells.\nThe SwitchBot Lock Ultra Vision is a retrofit smart lock that works with a keypad that has facial recognition built in. The keypad also has a fingerprint reader and auto-unlock. The lock can work with almost any style of door lock, connects over Bluetooth, and works with Apple Home (through Matter), Amazon Alexa, and Google Home with a SwitchBot hub. \nThe Schlage Sense Pro is the company’s first lock to support  Matter and one of the first to use ultra-wideband technology (UWB) for hands-free unlocking. It has a keypad but no keyway and will work with the Aliro standard when it launches. This means it should support a version of Apple Home Key.\nU-tec’s Ultraloq Bolt Mission is a $400 lock that will work with UWB for hands-free unlocking; it also has a keypad and a keyway, and the company says it will support Matter.\nThe Yale Smart Lock with Matter is a $170 smart lock that works over Thread and is a full-deadbolt replacement featuring a keypad and keyway for access. It’s designed to pair with Google’s Nest video doorbells.\nThe Ultraloq Bolt NFC HomeKey ($249) is U-tec’s first Apple Home Key smart lock slated for release soon. There’s no fingerprint reader, but there is a keypad and a physical key. Built-in Wi-Fi adds support for Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings.\nSmart lock FAQs\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, July 16th: Replaced our pick for the “best retrofit smart lock” with the Nuki Smart Lock.
