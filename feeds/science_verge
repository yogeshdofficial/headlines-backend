Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-apple-watch-se-deals\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#zdhvKu\">The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#MpVWgd\">A note on the more premium models</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch\">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s get to the deals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p>\n\n<p>While the improvements are welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Series 9</a>.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($10 off), which remains its lowest price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $329 ($100 off) — which is the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at $389 ($110 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022.
