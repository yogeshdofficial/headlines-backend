While steeper discounts are surely to arrive when things kick off on July 8th, many of the current offers are already worth considering, especially if you’re a Prime member looking to score a deal on one of Amazon’s own devices or services. Most of these offers are exclusive to Prime members; however, some retailers are price-matching Amazon’s deals, meaning non-members can still take advantage of some of the same savings.\nFrom new lows on security gear and power stations to solid deals on streaming devices, Echo speakers, and Kindles, here are our top picks.\nWe’ll be updating this guide over the next day or two as new deals drop, so be sure to check back if you want to stay on top of the latest deals. We also suggest bookmarking our main Prime Day hub for additional tips and insights into what is likely going to be one of the biggest shopping events of the year.\nAmazon Echo Spot\nThe newer Echo Spot is an excellent smart alarm clock with decent sound for its size and no camera. It features Amazon’s smart voice assistant for voice control and is worthy of a spot on your nightstand.

Although it was built primarily for Amazon’s cloud-gaming service, the gamepad offers support for both Bluetooth and USB-C connectivity, rendering it compatible with Android phones, Apple products, Fire TV devices, and PCs. It also integrates with Alexa, allowing you to issue voice commands directly through the controller when paired with a Fire TV device.\nSamsung’s 2TB T9 portable USB-C SSD is currently $169.99 ($130 off), its lowest price in over a year, at Amazon. The drive can read and write data at up to 2,000Mbps when connected to a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 port. The T9 has substantially faster data transfer speeds than an external spinning hard drive (it’s more reliable, too, since it has no moving parts). The drive is fast enough to store an uncompressed stream of 4K Pro Res video at 60 frames per second directly from an iPhone 15 Pro or newer. Amazon has also discounted the 4TB model to $319.99 ($230 off) if you need more space.\nAmazon Echo Dot (fifth-gen)\nThe fifth-gen Echo Dot touts a temperature sensor, better sound, and faster response time than the prior model. It can also act as an extender for your Eero Wi-Fi system.

The excellent handheld vacuum cleaner comes with a motorized pet brush with rubber bristles, which won’t get caught when you’re picking up hair. You can also use its extra-large, retractable crevice tool to clean tall places, or push the vacuum’s so-called “powerboost” button to maximize its suction power for dirt or hair that’s stuck deep within carpeting.\nIf you want cleaner floors, you can pick up Shark’s AV752 IO Robot Vacuum for $179.99 (about $70 off) at Amazon, which is one of the better prices we’ve seen as of late. The budget robovac uses three brushes to clean your floors and has sensors to avoid obstacles, including stairs, and it’s thin enough to fit beneath furniture. It can run for up to two hours per charge, and you can schedule cleanings using the SharkClean app, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant.\nEcho Pop\nThe newer Echo Pop is one of Amazon’s smallest Alexa-enabled smart speakers.

It lacks a display, however, and pairs best with an Echo device. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $44.99 at Amazon\n\nYou can buy a Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam with a Ring Pet Tag for $44.99 ($44.99 off) at Amazon, which is a new low price. Ring’s Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam rotates 360 degrees on a motorized base, which you can control via the Ring app. The wired 1080p camera also offers a physical privacy cover — just like the second-gen Ring Indoor Cam — along with support for video and color night vision, two-way talk, motion detection, and a built-in siren. The Ring Pet Tag, on the other hand, attaches to your pet’s collar and links to a digital profile anyone can access via a QR code.\nThe Alexa Voice Remote Pro is now available for just $24.99 ($10 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, marking its lowest price to date.
