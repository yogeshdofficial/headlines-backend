Most of us probably won’t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. We now even have models that can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338956/dreame-robot-vacuum-legs-arm-tools\">pick up dirty laundry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24333438/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-plus-pro-price-specs-release-date\">purify the air</a> in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#best-roborock-deals\">The best Roborock deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#KkTLAn\">The best Dreame deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-switchbot-deals\">The best SwitchBot deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-eufy-deals\">The best Eufy deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#KkTLAn\">The best Yeedi deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-shark-deals\">The best Shark deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-roomba-deals\">The best Roomba deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#other-robot-vacuum-deals\">Other robot vacuum deals</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of <em>Verge</em>-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-roborock-deals\">The best Roborock deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Roborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra</strong>, our pick for the best robot vacuum overall, is available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQLQVTDH/\">Amazon</a> for $999.99 ($800 off) — its best price to date — as a part of a limited-time lightning deal. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. It’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Roborock Q8 Max Plus </strong>is a cheaper alternative you can currently pick up from <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-q8-max-plus-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-auto-empty-dock?srsltid=AfmBOoq4JKuiH3yDQiqUtHx5zaIb2Klkr-LlK7Ujr2WIjctpv1hKs6Ti\">Roborock</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Q8-Max-Self-Emptying-APP-Controlled/dp/B0C7VH6VK1\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.lowes.com/pd/Roborock-Auto-Charging-Pet-Robotic-Vacuum-and-Mop-Self-Emptying/5014971037?user=shopping&amp;feed=yes&amp;srsltid=AfmBOooz9TcSuzQg4p4uuknCUTAU6r_ibsgC9WC-9QAIO1FPKWnseo95tmE\">Lowe’s</a> for $399.99 ($419 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen.<strong> </strong>It isn’t as powerful or feature-packed as the S8 MaxV Ultra, but it still delivers a solid 5,500Pa of suction power, rendering it good enough for most cleaning tasks. It also handles mopping well, with 30 adjustable water flow levels and a sizable 350ml water tank that allows it to cover larger areas without frequent refills. The robovac can map your home efficiently and avoid most obstacles thanks to built-in lidar navigation, though it lacks a built-in camera for advanced object recognition.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KkTLAn\">The best Dreame deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Dreame X40 Ultra</strong> is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for <strong>$999.99 ($500 off) from <a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/dreametech-x40-ultra-robot-vacuum\">Dreame</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0DZHNSL1H\">Amazon</a> (if you’re a Prime member), which is $100 shy of its all-time low.</strong> You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.</p>\n\n<p>The Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Dreame L20 Ultra</strong> is currently available for $649.99 ($350 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT\">Amazon</a> (for Prime members) and <a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/l20-ultra\">Dreame</a>, which is $90 shy of its all-time low but still one of its better prices to date. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-switchbot-deals\">The best SwitchBot deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>SwitchBot S10</strong> is available<strong> </strong>directly from <a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-floor-cleaning-robot-s10\">SwitchBot</a> for an all-time low of $459.99 ($740 off) when you use coupon code <strong>SYPT700</strong>. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.</p>\n\n<p>The S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125273/switchbot-robot-vacuum-matter-support\">robovacs with Matter support</a>, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5ticpp\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">Read our SwitchBot S10 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>SwitchBot K10 Plus </strong>is available for $176 ($224 off) from <strong><a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-mini-robot-vacuum-k10/\">SwitchBot</a></strong> (with promo code <strong>SYPT505</strong>), which is an all-time low.&nbsp;At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-eufy-deals\">The best Eufy deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</strong> — our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop — is down to an all-time low of $549.99 ($250 off) at <a href=\"https://howl.link/ung9fkamv1txn\">Eufy’s online storefront</a> when you use promo code WS7DV2T3DNEO, with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eufy-x10-pro-omni-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-self-washing-and-self-drying-auto-empty-station-black/6576392.p\">Best Buy</a> matching said deal price.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock <em>too</em> frequently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now through June 25th, the Omni S1 Pro is on sale for an all-time low of $799.99 ($500 off) when you purchase it <a href=\"https://www.eufy.com/products/t2071111\">directly from Eufy</a> with offer code WS24T2071111. The S1 Pro is an excellent robovac if you have mostly hardwood floors, with a long 11.4-inch roller mop, a square shape, and dual spinning side brushes that leave floors spotless (it can even reach into corners).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, the S1 Pro is capable of self-washing its own mop with water jets as it cleans, which it can then dry afterward using hot air. It’s also a decent vacuum with 8,000Pa of suction, which is enough power to pick up most debris. Its AI-powered obstacle avoidance system is effective as well, allowing it to navigate around larger objects with relative ease.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re looking for a bump-and-roll model that’s relatively budget-friendly,<strong> <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Fblogs%2Frobovac%2Frobovac-11s-discontinued%3Fvariant%3D37765852496058%26nrtv_cid%3Dfsto791yl9tk5\">the discontinued</a> Eufy 11S Max </strong>is still on sale <strong>at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Super-Thin-Super-Strong-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile/dp/B07R295MLS\">Amazon</a> for just $159.99 ($120 off). T</strong>he 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It’s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KkTLAn\">The best Yeedi deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Yeedi Cube</strong> is currently down to an all-time low of<strong> $246.99 ($243 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-Washing-Emptying-Obstacle-Climbing/dp/B0CDX5QL9T\">Amazon</a> at checkout.</strong> It’s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.</p>\n\n<p>With 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-shark-deals\">The best Shark deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The<strong> Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1</strong> is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s now on sale for $399.99 ($320 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Mopping-CleanEdge-Technology-RV2610WA/dp/B0B8B6N2G4\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/shark-matrix-plus-2-in-1-robot-vacuum-mop-with-sonic-mopping-matrix-clean-home-mapping-hepa-bagless-self-empty-wifi-black/6514530.p\">Best Buy</a>, and directly from <a href=\"https://www.sharkclean.com/products/shark-matrix-plus-2-in-1-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-xl-hepa-self-empty-base-zidRV2610WA\">Shark</a>, which is $20 shy of its all-time low price. Before the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG5G9HQM/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0417awD__22761638__6038________________\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eufy X10 Pro Omni</a> took its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-roomba-deals\">The best Roomba deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can get<strong> iRobot’s Roomba Combo 10 Max</strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D9ZRH61T/\">Amazon</a> for $799.99 ($600 off), which is its second-best price to date. </strong>We think it’s the best robot vacuum for pet hair, one that combines high suction power with rotating dual rubber brushes that pick up without getting tangled. What’s even more impressive is that it comes with a new multifunction charging dock that allows it to empty its bin, wash its own mop, and even refill its mopping tank. Add in Matter support, excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, and a retractable mop arm, and you’ve got a robovac that makes cleaning almost entirely hands-free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re working with a tight budget, the <strong>Combo i5 </strong>is also a good vacuum / mop — one you can pick up on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C415KNH8/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba-combo-i5-robot-vacuum-and-mop/I517020.html\">directly from iRobot</a> right now for $199, down from $349.99. It’s not as powerful as the aforementioned Combo 10 Max and can’t refill its water tank or wash and dry its own mop; however, it still features Roomba’s wide, dual rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of picking up dirt and debris. It doesn’t support virtual keep-out zones or Matter, either, though you can schedule it to clean specific rooms at set times. It’s also compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and like all Roombas, it’s relatively easy to repair.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"other-robot-vacuum-deals\">Other robot vacuum deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, June 20th: </strong>Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and a newer deal for the Eufy Omni S1 Pro.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"The Eufy X10 Pro Omni, our favorite midrange robot vacuum / mop, is on sale for $250 off. | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\t\n\nWe’re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it’s a self-driving car or a robot that can clean on your behalf.

You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture.

The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.\nThe L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nThe SwitchBot S10 is available directly from SwitchBot for an all-time low of $459.99 ($740 off) when you use coupon code SYPT700. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.\nThe S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few robovacs with Matter support, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).\nRead our SwitchBot S10 review.\nThe SwitchBot K10 Plus is available for $176 ($224 off) from SwitchBot (with promo code SYPT505), which is an all-time low. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.\nThe best Eufy deals\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni — our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop — is down to an all-time low of $549.99 ($250 off) at Eufy’s online storefront when you use promo code WS7DV2T3DNEO, with Amazon and Best Buy matching said deal price.\nThe X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.\nMind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock too frequently.\nNow through June 25th, the Omni S1 Pro is on sale for an all-time low of $799.99 ($500 off) when you purchase it directly from Eufy with offer code WS24T2071111. The S1 Pro is an excellent robovac if you have mostly hardwood floors, with a long 11.4-inch roller mop, a square shape, and dual spinning side brushes that leave floors spotless (it can even reach into corners).\nWhat’s more, the S1 Pro is capable of self-washing its own mop with water jets as it cleans, which it can then dry afterward using hot air. It’s also a decent vacuum with 8,000Pa of suction, which is enough power to pick up most debris. Its AI-powered obstacle avoidance system is effective as well, allowing it to navigate around larger objects with relative ease. \nIf you’re looking for a bump-and-roll model that’s relatively budget-friendly, the discontinued Eufy 11S Max is still on sale at Amazon for just $159.99 ($120 off). The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It’s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.\nThe best Yeedi deals\nThe Yeedi Cube is currently down to an all-time low of $246.99 ($243 off) at Amazon at checkout. It’s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.\nWith 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.\nThe best Shark deals\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s now on sale for $399.99 ($320 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Shark, which is $20 shy of its all-time low price. Before the Eufy X10 Pro Omni took its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.\nThe best Roomba deals\nYou can get iRobot’s Roomba Combo 10 Max from Amazon for $799.99 ($600 off), which is its second-best price to date. We think it’s the best robot vacuum for pet hair, one that combines high suction power with rotating dual rubber brushes that pick up without getting tangled. What’s even more impressive is that it comes with a new multifunction charging dock that allows it to empty its bin, wash its own mop, and even refill its mopping tank. Add in Matter support, excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, and a retractable mop arm, and you’ve got a robovac that makes cleaning almost entirely hands-free.\nIf you’re working with a tight budget, the Combo i5 is also a good vacuum / mop — one you can pick up on sale at Amazon and directly from iRobot right now for $199, down from $349.99. It’s not as powerful as the aforementioned Combo 10 Max and can’t refill its water tank or wash and dry its own mop; however, it still features Roomba’s wide, dual rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of picking up dirt and debris. It doesn’t support virtual keep-out zones or Matter, either, though you can schedule it to clean specific rooms at set times. It’s also compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and like all Roombas, it’s relatively easy to repair.\nOther robot vacuum deals\nUpdate, June 20th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and a newer deal for the Eufy Omni S1 Pro.","summary":"We’re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it’s a self-driving car or a robot that can clean on your behalf.

Read our review.\nThe best iPad and Apple Pencil deals\nYou can buy the latest iPad with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage at Amazon and Walmart starting at $299 ($50 off), which matches its best price to date. The 11th-gen model is a pretty minor upgrade over the 2022 iPad with twice as much base storage and an A16 Bionic chip, which, while faster, doesn’t support any of Apple’s AI-based Apple Intelligence feature. Read our review.\nThe Apple Pencil (USB-C) is available from Woot for just $59.99 ($20 off) until July 1st. That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen on the comfortable Apple stylus, which can magnetically attach to the side of most iPad models from within the past three years or so. It also offers tilt sensitivity, though it lacks the Apple Pencil Pro’s pressure sensitivity and support for wireless charging.\nThe best MacBook deals\nThe M4-powered MacBook Air 13 is available at Amazon and B&H Photo with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage starting at just $849 ($150 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low. The latest Air is faster than its predecessor thanks to the addition of Apple’s newer M4 chip, and now offers double the base RAM at 16GB. It also features a sharper 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam and supports two external displays with the lid open, making it even better for multitasking. Read our review.\nIf you prefer the 15-inch Air, the entry-level configuration with the M4 chip, a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is down to its all-time low of $1,049 ($150 off) at Amazon. The larger Air is identical to its smaller sibling, only it features a better six-speaker sound system and comes with the option of either a 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or a 70W USB‑C Power Adapter.\nThe best Apple Watch deals\nYou can buy the latest 40mm, GPS-enabled Apple Watch SE at Amazon and Walmart for $189, which is $40 shy of its best price to date. Apple’s entry-level wearable is great for tracking the essentials, including your heart rate and sleep quality, and offers fall/crash detection, Apple Pay, and other conveniences. While it lacks the Series 10’s temperature sensor, EKG, and depth tracking, the SE still delivers excellent value if you don’t need advanced health features. It will also support the next iteration of watchOS, watchOS 26, when it arrives in the fall with its new wrist flick gesture and AI-powered “Workout Buddy.” Read our review.\nAir tags and other miscellaneous deals\nYou can buy the Anker MagGo Wireless Charger (Pad) at Amazon for $19.19 ($10 off) right now, which matches the charger’s best price to date. Anker’s Qi2-certified charging pad can deliver up to 15W of power to MagSafe-compatible iPhones, including the newer iPhone 16 models. It also comes with a five-foot cable; however, you will still need to supply your own AC adapter unless you spring for the $24 bundle.\nAnker’s MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) is available for an all-time low of $82.49 (about $28 off) at Amazon and directly from Anker (with code WS7DV2KWSEEN). The Qi2-certified charger can deliver up to 15W of power to compatible iPhone models while simultaneously charging a pair of AirPods and an Apple Watch. Its foldable, lightweight design also makes it convenient for travel or keeping your nightstand clutter-free.","summary":"If you want to get a head start on back-to-school shopping — or upgrade your Apple gear — there are already some great deals worth exploring ahead of Amazon Prime Day.
