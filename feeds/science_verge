The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"

L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Just like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review\">WF-1000XM4</a> so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.</p>\n\n<p>Some people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24805959/DSCF2249_Enhanced_NR.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" title=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The WF-1000XM5 are smaller and more comfortable than their M4 predecessors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SUJOO3\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23803374/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review\">Read our&nbsp;full WF-1000XM5 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d26N53\">The best budget earbuds under $100</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Nothing Ear (a)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow.

Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro.

The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, it’s worth noting that Bose <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/686448/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen2-wireless-earbuds-anc-soundlink-plus-micro-speakers\">recently announced an updated version</a> of the QC Ultra Earbuds, which, with the help of AI, supposedly offer improved call quality and enhanced&nbsp;adaptive ANC to help curb sudden spikes in noise.

They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.</p>\n\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/620706/powerbeats-pro-2-apple-heart-rate-gym-equipment\">can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment</a> when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.<br></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257536_Powerbeats_Pro_2_AKrales_0129.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro 2 have an ear-hook design for maximum stability.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orqrNZ\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/headphone-review/609473/powerbeats-pro-2-review-headphones-heart-rate-monitoring-wearables\">Read our full&nbsp;Powerbeats Pro 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"MzRNQU\">The best earbuds for iPhone owners</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24043027/DSCF9466.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro photographed on a reflective black surface.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Much better noise cancellation</li><li>Improved sound quality and clarity</li><li>Unrivaled hearing health features</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Unchanged design</li><li>Sound is better but not top tier</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\"> <strike>$249</strike> $169 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation-with-MagSafe-Case-USB-C/5689919121/\"> <strike>$249</strike> $169 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-hearing-aid-feature-white/6447382.p?skuId=6447382\"> <strike>$249.99</strike> $169.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>6<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>For those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review\">second-gen AirPods Pro</a> bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair.

Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you.</p>\n\n<p>Where the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model.

It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed.

This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life.

Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"N3Z6oA\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear\">Read our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ziSHXY\">The best earbuds for sound quality</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25311367/DSC_0448_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds in copper.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Fantastic sound quality</li><li>Improved day-to-day reliability</li><li>Auracast-enabled</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Too pricey for some</li><li>Noise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special</li><li>Long-term durability remains to be seen</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-MOMENTUM-Bluetooth-Crystal-Clear-Comfortable/dp/B0CTQ5ZBZH/\"> <strike>$349.95</strike> $299.95 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1808815-REG/sennheiser_700367_sennheiser_momentum_true_wireless.html\"> $349.95 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sennheiser-hearing.com/en-US/p/momentum-true-wireless-4/\"> $349.95 at <strong>Sennheiser</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>7.5 hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP54 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint: </strong>Yes / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue.

However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"PxCkgD\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review\">Read our full AirPods 4 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pTcGEr\">The best earbuds for voice calls on Android</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25664552/DSC_0886.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A hands-on photo of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro earbuds.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Terrific sound quality</li><li>Crisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode</li><li>Voice commands are simple and so useful</li><li>Good voice calls</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Uninspired design</li><li>Midtier noise cancellation performance</li><li>No true multipoint</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/dp/B0D9YZJ3V7/\"> <strike>$249.99</strike> $189.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://howl.link/jmukqjuazc0uk\"> <strike>$249.99</strike> $189.99 at <strong>Samsung</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-buds3-pro-wireless-earbud-headphones-silver/6585614.p\"> $249.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>6<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP57 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (S, M, L)</em></em></em></em></p>\n\n<p>Sony’s unconventional <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22933521/sony-linkbuds-earbuds-review-features-specs\">LinkBuds</a> were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors.

The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Sony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $213 at Amazon\n $329.99 $214.99 at Best Buy\n $329.99 $214.99 at Target\n\nBest noise-canceling: Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\nWith dynamic, rich sound and the best ANC available, the QC Ultra Earbuds are a terrific pick if you want to listen to your music in peace.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Walmart\n $299 at Best Buy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nSony WF-1000XM5\nSony’s flagship wireless earbuds offer the company’s best noise cancellation, powerful and lively sound, and a comfortable fit.

Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow.

But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my full Nothing Ear (a) impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMost powerful ANC you’ll find in earbuds\nLively, rich sound\nStabilizer fins are easier to apply\n\nImmersive Audio drains battery\nWireless charging requires $49 case\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299 at Amazon\n $299 at Walmart\n $299 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nBose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job of offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life, putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts.\nThe QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II in terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio.\nThat being said, it’s worth noting that Bose recently announced an updated version of the QC Ultra Earbuds, which, with the help of AI, supposedly offer improved call quality and enhanced adaptive ANC to help curb sudden spikes in noise. They’ll also retail for the same price as the current model and come with a wireless charging case when they launch later this year, preventing you from having to pay extra for what has essentially become a table-stakes feature.\nRead our full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuzzah!

They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nApple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMuch better noise cancellation\nImproved sound quality and clarity\nUnrivaled hearing health features\n\nUnchanged design\nSound is better but not top tier\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $169 at Amazon\n $249 $169 at Walmart\n $249.99 $169.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nFor those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option.\nThe AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you.\nWhere the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem.\nLast year, Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health features for the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss.\nRead our original AirPods Pro (second-gen) review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $189.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $189.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but I’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSmaller and lighter design is supremely comfortable\nMore powerful noise cancellation\nCrystal-clear transparency mode\nVery pleasant and detailed sound quality\n\nANC can’t quite match Bose\nGoogle still refuses to add higher-quality Bluetooth codecs, limiting overall fidelity\nGemini Live feels more feeble than futuristic\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $229 $189 at Amazon\n $229 $189 at Best Buy\n $229 $189 at Google Store\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nBeats Studio Buds Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBetter sound, ANC, and battery life than Studio Buds\nStandout translucent case option\nImproved voice call performance\n\nANC and transparency fall short of second-gen AirPods Pro\nDoesn’t offer all Apple ecosystem tricks\nNo wireless charging or in-ear detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.95 $99.95 at Amazon\n $169.95 $99.95 at Walmart\n $169.99 $99.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nFantastic sound quality\nImproved day-to-day reliability\nAuracast-enabled\n\nToo pricey for some\nNoise cancellation does the job, but isn’t anything special\nLong-term durability remains to be seen\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.95 $299.95 at Amazon\n $349.95 at B&H Photo\n $349.95 at Sennheiser\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nApple AirPods 4\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpgraded sound quality\nVoice isolation can noticeably improve call clarity\nDeep Apple ecosystem integration\n\nNo wireless charging\nNo built-in speaker on the case\nNo proper multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129.99 $99 at Amazon\n $129.99 $99 at Walmart\n $129.99 $99.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTerrific sound quality\nCrisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode\nVoice commands are simple and so useful\nGood voice calls\n\nUninspired design\nMidtier noise cancellation performance\nNo true multipoint\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $189.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 $189.99 at Samsung\n $249.99 at Best Buy\n\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for me during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear me without issue, even when I’m answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nWhat’s coming next\nGoogle’s next Pixel event is scheduled for August 20th. We’re expecting it to primarily focus on the company’s forthcoming Pixel 10 series and the Pixel Watch 4; however, a recent leak also indicates we might see the introduction of the Pixel Buds 2A, Google’s next pair of budget-friendly earbuds. Not much is known beyond the name, but given the Pixel Buds A-Series launched way back in 2021, a replacement this fall wouldn’t be surprising.\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge except where specified\nUpdate, August 6th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and mention the Pixel Buds 2A.

It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it generally picked up all visible debris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water for a good surface clean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as three rotations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can also set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s also easy to start a clean from the app, and I really like that you can tap on the map to send the robot to that spot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally has trouble repositioning itself on its dock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best budget robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Roborock S8 Plus</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Roborock’s hybrid S8 robot vacuum and mop features 6,000Pa of suction and sonic mopping, which means its flat mop pad vibrates to scrub floors.

Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do an excellent job on hard floors and carpets, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the option of pairing the S8 with a fairly sleek auto-empty dock, but unlike Roborock’s QRevo line (which starts at around $600), the dock won’t automatically fill the water tank or wash the mop; you’ll have to do that work manually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Formerly a flagship robot vacuum for Roborock, this once $750 bot can now be found for well under $500, even with its auto-empty dock. Its flat mop pad vibrates 3,000 times a second to simulate some good old-fashioned scrubbing, and the bot comes with an extra-large on-board water tank, which means it actually gets wet enough to be effective.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A9244.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Roborock S8 is an excellent vacuum and great mop.

It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another great feature at this price is that the S8 has carpet sensing and can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. This bot can also raise its wheels when it cleans messes like ketchup to prevent its brushes from getting sticky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings. The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). <span>If you want to avoid those chores, you’ll need to bump up to about $600 and get whichever&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Qrevo-Pro-Intelligent-Detection/dp/B0CQ25DFTT\">Roborock QRevo&nbsp;vac and mop is on sale.</a> This adds spinning mopping pads and an auto wash/dry/refill dock.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum-for-pet-hair\">Best budget robot vacuum for pet hair</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Roborock Q5 Pro</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">With a big 770ml bin and 5,500Pa of suction power, the Q5 Pro is a great budget option.

These are getting harder to find now that every bot wants to be a multitasker and also mop (the water reservoir takes up valuable dustbin room). So, I’m very pleased with Roborock’s Q5 Pro with its 770ml dustbin. </p>\n\n<p>This huge bin pairs with dual rubber roller brushes that are better at getting pet hair out of rugs than single brushes. The rubber is also less prone than bristles to getting tangled with hair, and combined with 5,500Pa suction power, this vacuum does a good job on very dirty floors. It does have a removable mopping pad with a small water tank built into it, too, which is useful for cleaning up the fine dust left behind by the vacuum, but it isn’t going to scrub your floors. It will, however, keep the pet hair at bay.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t confuse this with the cheaper <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-q5\">Roborock Q5</a>, however. That bot has a smaller bin, lower suction, shorter runtime, and only one roller brush. It’s worth spending the extra for the Pro.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25102890/8A0A0609.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;I like big bins and I cannot lie.

The dock is relatively compact and lightweight compared to previous versions. However, considering the size of the Q5 Pro’s bin, you&#8217;d only have to empty it three times before the dock’s 2.5-liter bag is also full.</p>\n\n<p>The Q5 Pro doesn&#8217;t have AI-powered obstacle avoidance, although it will dodge shoes and larger objects. It does have a huge 5,200mAh battery that will run for about four hours. It uses the excellent Roborock app and has all the same software features of the higher-end Roborock’s family, including lidar mapping and navigation, digital keep-out zones, room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and voice control.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"T8svSv\">Best basic bump-and-roll bot</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Shark Ion</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">A truly basic budget bot, the Shark has good suction power,   a big bin, and a roller brush made of bristle and plastic that doesn’t get tangled up easily.

It doesn’t map or have any special navigation features other than colliding with things and changing direction. It’s not fancy, but it gets the job done.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a good one to stick under a bed or desk and set to run when you’re not home, as it’s loud and rattly and will bang into everything in its path. But its big wheels and 120-minute runtime mean it’s less prone to getting stuck or running out of juice than simpler $200 bots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unlike many budget bots, it uses a hybrid roller brush that’s both bristle and plastic and doesn’t get as tangled as standard bristle brushes. Its short, squat side brushes are surprisingly effective at getting debris into the robot’s path, and because they’re short, they’re less prone to getting tangled in stray cords.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24869352/236749_Robot_Vacuum_Guide_Shark_0002.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Shark has big wheels and a hybrid brush that isn’t prone to tangles.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\" />\n<p>But the best thing ‘bout this bot is its tank-like wheels that will roll right over anything in its path, including high transitions between rooms, obstacles like lounger chair legs, and other furniture traps that regularly stump other bots. That’s a good thing, as there’s no mapping, obstacle detection, or any way to set keep-out zones here. This bot just goes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another bonus: replacement parts are easily available, making it simple to repair and just keep going.</p>\n\n<p>Shark doesn’t share suction power specs, but it ably handled all my tests, including the toughest: raw oatmeal. Those little flakes are hard to pick up; side brushes will spin them all over the floor. It did a good job on pet hair, too, although, like most robots I tested, it required at least two runs to get everything up effectively.</p>\n\n<p>The app is super basic: just on / off, scheduling, and a choice of three power levels (all loud). Disappointingly, you can only schedule it once a day. Most robots can be programmed to do two to three passes, but in place of that, I like the option to schedule it to go out twice to make sure it gets the job done. I couldn’t do that with the Shark. Still, you can press its button or use the app to send it out again if needed.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-budget-roomba-robot-vacuum\">Best budget Roomba robot vacuum</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>iRobot Roomba Combo i5</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Roomba Combo i5 Plus is the company’s budget vacuum and mop robot with room mapping features but no virtual keep-out zones.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/IMG_3026.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"iRobot Roomba Combo i5\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Great vacuuming</li><li>Room mapping</li><li>Reliable app</li><li></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No virtual keep-out zones</li><li>Can be aggressive</li><li>Have to roll up your carpets to mop</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba-combo-i5-robot-vacuum-and-mop/I517020.html\"> <strike>$349.99</strike> $199.99 at <strong>iRobot</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/iRobot-Roomba-Combo-i5-Robot-Vacuum-and-Mop-with-4-Stage-Cleaning-System/5074614907\"> <strike>$549.99</strike> $299 at <strong>Walmart (with self-emptying dock)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Suction power:</strong> unknown <strong>/</strong> <strong>Dustbin capacity:</strong> 419ml<strong> /</strong> <strong>Runtime:</strong> 90 minutes <strong>/</strong> <strong>Brush style: </strong>dual rubber <strong>/</strong> <strong>Auto-empty dock option:</strong> yes <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mopping option:</strong> yes<strong> / Mapping:</strong> yes<strong> /</strong> <strong>Keep-out zones:</strong> physical only<strong> / Works with:</strong> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Roomba i5 is the follow-up to my previous top pick for a budget robot, the Roomba i3.

There’s no carpet avoidance, though, so I had to roll up the ends of my carpets to block it from going on them. </p>\n\n<p>But this bot is best as a vacuum, and it cleans almost as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22880352/irobot-roomba-j7-plus-samsung-jet-bot-ai-plus-robot-vacuum-review-comparison-test\">iRobot’s higher-end j7</a>, but for a lot less money. It has slightly lower suction power, but it boasts Roomba’s signature dual roller rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of removing pet hair from hardwood floors and sucking up oatmeal from plush carpets. These are slightly different from the Roborock dual brushes, and I find the nubs make them more effective at digging out the dirt, especially from carpet. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/IMG_3020.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The i5 can be purchased with an auto-empty dock, but like most budget bots, it just deals with the dust.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The i5 has mapping and room-specific cleaning, so you can send it to clean the kitchen if you want. However, unlike my top pick, the Tapo RV30, there’s no option to set virtual keep-out zones.

It also has a relatively small bin, but you can pair it with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Self-Emptying-Mapping-Personalized-Cleaning/dp/B0C4N37V2Z\">an auto-empty base</a> (although that doubles the cost).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The i5 is a solid vacuum with big wheels and a big bumper that can easily tackle any floor surface you throw at it. It can manage most transitions and is one of the only vacs I’ve tested that doesn’t get stuck on the uneven wooden floors in my screened-in porch. It does tend to bump into things, but it gets almost everywhere you want it to and won’t be put off by a bed skirt. But if you have delicate items on rickety tables, watch out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/IMG_3032.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The i5 Combo comes with swappable bins, one for mopping and vacuuming and one for just vacuuming.

This means it can automatically fill its onboard water tank, clean and dry its mop, and empty the bin. It also has more advanced obstacle avoidance tech than most budget bots, although, unlike the pricier bots, it uses lasers to see objects, not an AI-powered camera, which is less effective. While it originally retailed for $699.99, it’s now an older model and is regularly on sale for less than $500.</p>\n\n<p>The Yeedi resembles the Shark and Roomba in its full-speed-ahead nature. It will just run into things, and if it can clean them, great! It also only goes around larger objects. So, while it ably sucked up Cheerios and picked up all the oatmeal flakes, it got stuck on cords and socks. Definitely keep it away from pet waste.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A0465.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Yeedi has a big onboard bin and a large 1-litre water tank that it carries with it. &lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Yeedi’s mopping prowess is impressive. It scrubs the floor using a thin microfiber cloth that vibrates 2,500 times a minute to get up grime.

An onboard spot clean button means you don’t need to fuss with the app to get it to clean up a dedicated area.

Yes, some bots blow hot air on their bums (mop pads), deftly navigate dog poop, and have arms to pick up your socks, but there are plenty of basic budget robot vacuums that just do a decent job of cleaning your floor autonomously — as long as you tidy up first.\nFancier models have obstacle recognition, and some even use AI-powered cameras to tell popcorn from poop and avoid the latter. If you want one of those, check out my best robot vacuum buying guide. But if you think you can manage the task of picking up after yourself (and your puppy), a budget bot will save you a lot of money and still do a good job cleaning your floor. \nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Tapo RV30 Max Plus\nTap’s RV30 Max Plus is a robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $249.99 at TP-Link\n\nBest robovac / mop hybrid: Roborock S8 Plus\nRoborock’s S8 robot vacuum / mop features 6,000Pa of suction, sonic mopping, and dual rubber roller brushes that perform well on carpet.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 $349.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $499.99 at Amazon (with auto-empty dock)\n\n\n\n\nBest budget robot vacuum \nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nA budget robot vacuum and mop with high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, and smart navigation, it also features an auto-empty dock for just $80 more.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nCheap, even with the auto-empty dock \nA dual mop and dustbin means no swapping\nRoom-specific cleaning\nCarpet boost\n\nShort battery life\nSlow to recharge\nDocking can be spotty\nBasic obstacle detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $329.99 $249.99 at TP-Link\n\nSuction power: 5,300Pa / Dustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Mopping option: Yes / Mapping: Yes, lidar / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Runtime: 100 mins, 2,600mAh battery/ Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nFor around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.\nThanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. \nIts 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it generally picked up all visible debris.\nMopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water for a good surface clean.\nAnother unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as three rotations.\n\n5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price\n\n\nThe Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can also set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.\nIt’s also easy to start a clean from the app, and I really like that you can tap on the map to send the robot to that spot.\nThe biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally has trouble repositioning itself on its dock.\nYou can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nRoborock S8 Plus\nRoborock’s hybrid S8 robot vacuum and mop features 6,000Pa of suction and sonic mopping, which means its flat mop pad vibrates to scrub floors. It has dual rubber roller brushes that do a great job on carpet, and it can lift its mop to avoid carpet. It also has an auto-empty dock option.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSonic-mopping\nAuto-mop lift\nAI-powered obstacle avoidance\nDual-rubber roller brushes\nCarpet detection\n\nVery large and wide\nHave to wash the mop manually\nHave to refill the water tank manually\nNo heated drying\nLimited mop lift\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 $349.99 at Amazon \n $999.99 $499.99 at Amazon (with auto-empty dock)\n\nSuction power: 6,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 400ml / Runtime: 180 mins, 5,200mAh battery / Brush style: dual rubber / Auto-empty dock option: yes / Mapping: yes, lidar navigation / Keep-out zones: yes, virtual / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roborock S8 is a great vacuum that mops well and has AI-powered obstacle detection—a rarity at this price point. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do an excellent job on hard floors and carpets, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors. \nThere’s the option of pairing the S8 with a fairly sleek auto-empty dock, but unlike Roborock’s QRevo line (which starts at around $600), the dock won’t automatically fill the water tank or wash the mop; you’ll have to do that work manually.\nFormerly a flagship robot vacuum for Roborock, this once $750 bot can now be found for well under $500, even with its auto-empty dock. Its flat mop pad vibrates 3,000 times a second to simulate some good old-fashioned scrubbing, and the bot comes with an extra-large on-board water tank, which means it actually gets wet enough to be effective.\nThe S8 can be set to mop only — something few budget bots offer, and its mop-only mode does an excellent job, moving in a tighter “Z” pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though.\nAnother great feature at this price is that the S8 has carpet sensing and can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. This bot can also raise its wheels when it cleans messes like ketchup to prevent its brushes from getting sticky.\nHowever, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings. The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). If you want to avoid those chores, you’ll need to bump up to about $600 and get whichever Roborock QRevo vac and mop is on sale. This adds spinning mopping pads and an auto wash/dry/refill dock.\nBest budget robot vacuum for pet hair\nRoborock Q5 Pro\nWith a big 770ml bin and 5,500Pa of suction power, the Q5 Pro is a great budget option. It has a removable mopping pad with a small built-in water tank, dual rubber brushes, lidar mapping, and keep-out zones, making it an excellent cleaning machine. It uses Roborock’s very good app and can pair with an auto-empty dock for extra convenience. \n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHuge, 770ml bin\nDual rubber roller brushes\nLidar mapping\nDigital keep-out zones\n\nNo carpet avoidance when mopping\nBasic obstacle avoidance\nMopping is lackluster\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429.99 $249.99 at Amazon \n $699.99 at Amazon (with auto-empty dock)\n\nSuction Power: 5,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 770ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Mopping option: Yes / Mapping: Yes, lidar / Suction power: 5,500Pa / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Runtime: 240 mins, 5,200mAh battery / Brush style: dual, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nMy recommendation for families with pets who don’t want to spend a small fortune on an auto-empty robot vacuum is to buy a good bot with a big bin. These are getting harder to find now that every bot wants to be a multitasker and also mop (the water reservoir takes up valuable dustbin room). So, I’m very pleased with Roborock’s Q5 Pro with its 770ml dustbin. \nThis huge bin pairs with dual rubber roller brushes that are better at getting pet hair out of rugs than single brushes. The rubber is also less prone than bristles to getting tangled with hair, and combined with 5,500Pa suction power, this vacuum does a good job on very dirty floors. It does have a removable mopping pad with a small water tank built into it, too, which is useful for cleaning up the fine dust left behind by the vacuum, but it isn’t going to scrub your floors. It will, however, keep the pet hair at bay.\nDon’t confuse this with the cheaper Roborock Q5, however. That bot has a smaller bin, lower suction, shorter runtime, and only one roller brush. It’s worth spending the extra for the Pro.\nThe Q5 Pro Plus pairs the bot with the redesigned Roborock auto-empty dock if you really don’t like emptying the robot’s onboard bin, normally a hefty price bump, it’s often on sale at Amazon. The dock is relatively compact and lightweight compared to previous versions. However, considering the size of the Q5 Pro’s bin, you’d only have to empty it three times before the dock’s 2.5-liter bag is also full.\nThe Q5 Pro doesn’t have AI-powered obstacle avoidance, although it will dodge shoes and larger objects. It does have a huge 5,200mAh battery that will run for about four hours. It uses the excellent Roborock app and has all the same software features of the higher-end Roborock’s family, including lidar mapping and navigation, digital keep-out zones, room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and voice control.\nBest basic bump-and-roll bot\nShark Ion\nA truly basic budget bot, the Shark has good suction power,   a big bin, and a roller brush made of bristle and plastic that doesn’t get tangled up easily. There’s no mapping, keep out zones, or obstacle detection, but the bot does offer big wheels that easily roll over obstacles and high transitions between rooms. It’s easy to buy replacement parts, too, making this one that can go for years. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBig bin\nEasy to operate\nEasy to repair\nBig wheels means it can get over most transitions\n\nLoud and rattly\nNo mapping \nNo keep-out zones\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $149.99 at Amazon\n $249.99 at Shark\n\nSuction power: unknown / Dustbin capacity: 425ml /  Runtime: 120 mins / Brush style: single bristle / rubber hybrid / Auto-empty dock option: no / Mapping: no / Keep-out zones: no / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe Shark Ion’s big bin, simple app experience, decent battery life, repairability, and bullish nature make this an excellent bump-and-roll bot. It doesn’t map or have any special navigation features other than colliding with things and changing direction. It’s not fancy, but it gets the job done.\nIt’s a good one to stick under a bed or desk and set to run when you’re not home, as it’s loud and rattly and will bang into everything in its path. But its big wheels and 120-minute runtime mean it’s less prone to getting stuck or running out of juice than simpler $200 bots. \nUnlike many budget bots, it uses a hybrid roller brush that’s both bristle and plastic and doesn’t get as tangled as standard bristle brushes. Its short, squat side brushes are surprisingly effective at getting debris into the robot’s path, and because they’re short, they’re less prone to getting tangled in stray cords.\nBut the best thing ‘bout this bot is its tank-like wheels that will roll right over anything in its path, including high transitions between rooms, obstacles like lounger chair legs, and other furniture traps that regularly stump other bots. That’s a good thing, as there’s no mapping, obstacle detection, or any way to set keep-out zones here. This bot just goes. \nAnother bonus: replacement parts are easily available, making it simple to repair and just keep going.\nShark doesn’t share suction power specs, but it ably handled all my tests, including the toughest: raw oatmeal. Those little flakes are hard to pick up; side brushes will spin them all over the floor. It did a good job on pet hair, too, although, like most robots I tested, it required at least two runs to get everything up effectively.\nThe app is super basic: just on / off, scheduling, and a choice of three power levels (all loud). Disappointingly, you can only schedule it once a day. Most robots can be programmed to do two to three passes, but in place of that, I like the option to schedule it to go out twice to make sure it gets the job done. I couldn’t do that with the Shark. Still, you can press its button or use the app to send it out again if needed.\nBest budget Roomba robot vacuum\niRobot Roomba Combo i5\nThe Roomba Combo i5 Plus is the company’s budget vacuum and mop robot with room mapping features but no virtual keep-out zones.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat vacuuming\nRoom mapping\nReliable app\n\n\nNo virtual keep-out zones\nCan be aggressive\nHave to roll up your carpets to mop\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 $199.99 at iRobot\n $549.99 $299 at Walmart (with self-emptying dock)\n\nSuction power: unknown / Dustbin capacity: 419ml / Runtime: 90 minutes / Brush style: dual rubber / Auto-empty dock option: yes / Mopping option: yes / Mapping: yes / Keep-out zones: physical only / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roomba i5 is the follow-up to my previous top pick for a budget robot, the Roomba i3. It’s not the cheapest bot on the block, but its cleaning chops, attractive design, good software, and robust, easily-repairable hardware make it a good choice for spending a smaller budget. \nThe i5 brings mopping capability to the lower end of iRobot’s line via a swappable mopping bin that adds a flat mopping pad and a sizable 210ml reservoir. There’s no carpet avoidance, though, so I had to roll up the ends of my carpets to block it from going on them. \nBut this bot is best as a vacuum, and it cleans almost as well as iRobot’s higher-end j7, but for a lot less money. It has slightly lower suction power, but it boasts Roomba’s signature dual roller rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of removing pet hair from hardwood floors and sucking up oatmeal from plush carpets. These are slightly different from the Roborock dual brushes, and I find the nubs make them more effective at digging out the dirt, especially from carpet. \nThe i5 has mapping and room-specific cleaning, so you can send it to clean the kitchen if you want. However, unlike my top pick, the Tapo RV30, there’s no option to set virtual keep-out zones. If you have somewhere you don’t want the bot to roam, you’ll need to buy iRobot’s virtual wall towers. It also has a relatively small bin, but you can pair it with an auto-empty base (although that doubles the cost).  \nThe i5 is a solid vacuum with big wheels and a big bumper that can easily tackle any floor surface you throw at it. It can manage most transitions and is one of the only vacs I’ve tested that doesn’t get stuck on the uneven wooden floors in my screened-in porch. It does tend to bump into things, but it gets almost everywhere you want it to and won’t be put off by a bed skirt. But if you have delicate items on rickety tables, watch out.\nAs with all Roombas, the i5 is easy to self-repair, and you can buy (not inexpensive) replacements for all its parts. I’ve actually rebuilt an i3 (the previous model) after it rolled over some dog poop. There’s no obstacle avoidance here; you have to bump up to the Roomba j7 for that (which, if you can get it on sale anywhere, is a great robot vacuum.)  \niRobot also offers the Combo j5 for $529.99 (currently on sale for $225.29 249.99 at Amazon), adding more advanced mapping, including virtual keep-out zones and better obstacle and carpet detection. It also has a shinier finish, whereas the i5 retains the fabric-covered body of the i3. If you can find the j5 on sale for close to or less than the i3 (it’s $280 379 with the auto-empty dock on Amazon at the time of writing), go for it. Otherwise, the i3 is your best bet for a budget Roomba. \nBest budget robot vacuum without Wi-Fi\nEufy 11S Max\nThe Eufy 11S Max is a super slim, repairable bump-and-roll bot with a large 600ml bin and three cleaning levels. Its biggest selling point for some, however, is that it lacks Wi-Fi, meaning you don’t have to fiddle with an app.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBig bin\nSlim profile\nAvoids obstacles\nQuiet\nEasily repairable\n\nNo mapping\nNo keep-out zones\nSmall battery\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279.99 $159.99 at Amazon\n $279.99 $159.99 at Walmart\n $279.99 $159.99 at eBay\n\nSuction power: 2,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 600ml / Runtime: 100 mins / Brush style: single bristle / rubber hybrid / Auto-empty dock option: no / Mapping: no / Keep-out zones: no / Works with: n/a\nThe Eufy 11S Max is a rarity — a robot vacuum that doesn’t use Wi-Fi at all. There’s not even an app. Instead, you just press the button, and off it trundles. It also comes with a remote if you’d rather not get up off the couch, and you can use that to program it to clean at a specific time. \nThe 11S is super slim, 72.5 mm high, with no lidar tower, so it will get under most couches and very quiet. It has a big 600ml bin, and I was very impressed with how much it got up off my hardwood floors, even with its relatively small 2,000Pa of suction. There are three cleaning levels, and at the lowest, it registers around 55db, quiet enough to run in a home office.\nIt does have a smallish battery — only 100 minutes of runtime — but it will go back and recharge. For $200, this is the perfect budget bot for those wary of or who don’t want to deal with an app and Wi-Fi. It’s a bump-and-roll bot, meaning there are no real navigation skills. But it has plenty of replaceable parts, including the battery and wheels, so you can keep it going for a long time.\nBest self-cleaning, self-emptying robot vacuum / mop under $500\nYeedi Cube\nOne of the first robots that can vacuum, mop, self-empty, self-wash, and self-dry with hot air for under $1,000, the Yeedi Cube is an older model that currently retails for under $500. It’s a good vacuum and mop for hands-free cleaning on a budget.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEffective vibration mopping\nMultifunctional dock\nCarrying handle\nBig water tank\n\nNavigation can be spotty\nObstacle avoidance isn’t great\nThe app is a bit fiddly\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $469.99 $199.99 at Amazon\n\nSuction Power: 5,100Pa / Dustbin capacity: 360ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Mopping option: Yes / Mapping: Yes, lidar / Suction power: 5,100Pa / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Runtime/Battery: 180 mins, 5,400mAh / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe Yeedi Cube is the least expensive robot vacuum with the same kind of multifunction dock and high-end features as robots over $1,000. This means it can automatically fill its onboard water tank, clean and dry its mop, and empty the bin. It also has more advanced obstacle avoidance tech than most budget bots, although, unlike the pricier bots, it uses lasers to see objects, not an AI-powered camera, which is less effective. While it originally retailed for $699.99, it’s now an older model and is regularly on sale for less than $500.\nThe Yeedi resembles the Shark and Roomba in its full-speed-ahead nature. It will just run into things, and if it can clean them, great! It also only goes around larger objects. So, while it ably sucked up Cheerios and picked up all the oatmeal flakes, it got stuck on cords and socks. Definitely keep it away from pet waste.\nThe Yeedi’s mopping prowess is impressive. It scrubs the floor using a thin microfiber cloth that vibrates 2,500 times a minute to get up grime. The dock cleans the mopping pad, drains the dirty water, and auto empties the bin, but the robot carries its one-liter water tank around on its back, so it doesn’t need to go back and refill during a run.\nOne downside is that it uses a single hybrid rubber / bristle brush, which gets tangled with hair. However, combined with 5,100Pa of suction power, it did a good job of picking up dirt from the floors.\nI really liked the handle; it makes it easy to pick up the vacuum and put it where you want to clean. An onboard spot clean button means you don’t need to fuss with the app to get it to clean up a dedicated area. The map offers room-specific cleaning and keep-out zones for vacuuming and mopping but can be a bit fiddly to use.\nWhat’s coming next\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup includes several budget-friendly options — including the $219.99 $319.99 Roomba 105 Combo and the $319.99 $469.99 Roomba 205 DustCompactor Combo, neither of which we’ve tested. Both entry-level models can vacuum and mop, offer lidar navigation and mapping, and tout 7,000Pa of suction power. They also both offer virtual keep-out zones and automatic carpet detection and avoidance; however, the 205 features a new onboard debris and dust compactor, which iRobot says allows you to go eight weeks without emptying the vacuum.\nUpdate, August 6th: Adjusted pricing and availability.
