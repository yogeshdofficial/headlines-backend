You won’t be able to pick the top right position though, presumably because that would place the indicator too close to the minimize, maximize, and close buttons for apps.\nAlongside the indicator changes, Microsoft is also testing a new Recall homepage. “The new homepage brings your recent activity and top-used content front and center, enabling you to easily get back to your previous tasks,” says Microsoft’s Windows Insider team. The homepage shows recent snapshots as well as top apps or websites that have been used in the past 24 hours.\nRecall is also getting a new navigation bar on the left side, which lets you quickly switch between this new home interface and the Timeline feature to scroll through all your snapshots. Microsoft is currently testing these changes with Windows Insiders, so expect to see them appear more broadly in Windows 11 in the coming months.","summary":"Microsoft is testing a new feature in Windows 11 that will let you move hardware indicators pop-ups like volume and screen brightness to the top-left and top-center positions of a display.

It was developed for the Accell Group’s Raleigh brand with help from VanMoof’s cofounders, Ties and Taco Carlier, according to my sources. The announcement never mentions their involvement, which could be viewed as good or bad — good if you view the brothers as innovators, bad if you got burned during the VanMoof bankruptcy or the turmoil that preceded it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think everyone can agree, however, that the decision to put several functions behind monthly subscription tiers that start at £6.99 / €7.99 (around $9) per month is annoying, especially for a list price of £2,399 / €2,699 (around $3,000 USD) when Raleigh One sales begin next month in the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands. That’s expensive for a Raleigh, but it’s still close to the <a href=\"https://www.bike-eu.com/50105/e-bike-sales-in-europe-see-further-cooling-down\">€2,681 average</a> for European e-bikes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Raleigh One looks very VanMoof-ish but with several features that fans and critics alike have asked for: the 360Wh battery can be removed for easy charging, and it’s fitted with a single-speed belt drive paired to a motor housed in the hub of the rear wheel. If you squint, it could be easily mistaken for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tenways.com/products/cgo009\">Tenways CGO009</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/RALEIGHONEHEROIMAGE.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Available in two colors, one frame size, and a few options for front carry.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When asked about the Carlier brothers’ involvement with the e-bike, Ertu Bilgin, Accell Group brand lead, confirmed that “some former VanMoof team members have brought their experience” to the Raleigh One, but it’s “very much a product of the Accell Group.“</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The urban commuter comes with beefy tires to soak up bumps and a few mounts to help haul your gear around the city (with more to come). The integrated lighting adapts to conditions with a “dual-front” light that can be moved off the frame and onto the optional front rack. There’s a simple controller on the bike to adjust power, which can also be set in the Raleigh app. The app lets riders tap into additional features like an integrated alarm system and GPS tracking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bike weighs 21kg (46.3 pounds) and is only available in a single step-over frame model. It ships with a 5A brick that can charge the e-bike to 50 percent in one hour or to full in a fast 2 hours and 20 minutes. Range is estimated at 80km (50 miles) in eco mode or at 50km (31 miles) when adding more pedal-assisted power. This is Europe so there’s no throttle here, and there’s no button to provide a temporary boost.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike VanMoofs, the Raleigh One uses a lot of off-the-shelf parts. I’m seeing hydraulic disc brakes from Tektro, a Gates Carbon belt, a 250W Mivice motor, and bike mount from SP Connect. “Built to last and easy to maintain, the Raleigh One delivers on reliability, with high-quality and low maintenance parts, backed up by a comprehensive dealer network,”&nbsp;the announcement promises.

Yale tells <em>The Verge</em> the price increase is due to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/645927/smart-home-device-manufacturers-are-bracing-for-chaos-again\">the impact of tariffs</a>. The lock will be available on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FB51J7X9\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shopyalehome.com/\">Yale’s website</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to Yale, the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23393163/best-smart-door-lock\">smart lock</a> was built for Google Home and Matter and designed specifically to complement Google Home’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23404602/google-nest-doorbell-wired-review-hello\">Nest video doorbells</a>.

I&#8217;m on board with the push buttons, but I think these locks would look much sleeker without the keyhole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lock can work with any platform that supports Matter, but Stroh said it has a “best in class integration with the Google Home platform.” He said it’s able to take “full advantage of the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/15711196\">Matter features Google Home supports</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These currently include creating and editing codes for the lock, including guest codes with set schedules.

But, while it will work with other platforms, it’s clearly designed to appeal to Google Home users.
