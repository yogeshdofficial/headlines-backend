While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>A robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that <em>excel</em> at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\">my guide to floor sweeping bots</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Combo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do, yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Best overall: Deebot X8 Pro Omni</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Deebot X8 Pro Omni is an excellent roller mopping bot that extends to clean along backboards and furniture.

Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ECOVACS-Self-Emptying-Auto-Refill-Obstacle-Avoidance/dp/B0CDPJ2C94\">Deebot X2 Omni</a>, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops).&nbsp;At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2991.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The roller mop can extend outwards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2977.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tank for cleaning solution is refillable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>This is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2975.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The water tanks are easily accessible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2960.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.173651910196,93.51484375,73.441109757773\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock is small with nice rose gold accents.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It&#8217;s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268508/hacked-ecovacs-deebot-x2-racial-slurs-chase-pets\">suffered a hack</a> last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it&#8217;s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn&#8217;t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can&#8217;t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best budget robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Roborock S8 Plus</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24762652/8A0A9237.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Sonic-mopping</li><li>Auto-mop lift</li><li>AI-powered obstacle avoidance</li><li>Dual-rubber roller brushes</li><li>Carpet detection</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Very large and wide</li><li>Have to wash the mop manually</li><li>Have to refill the water tank manually</li><li>No heated drying</li><li>Limited mop lift</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-S8-DuoRoller-ReactiveAI-Avoidance/dp/B0BVB1TRBN/\"> <strike>$749.99</strike> $399.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-S8-Robot-Vacuum/dp/B0BR5CGYKY\"> <strike>$999.99</strike> $519.99 at <strong>Amazon (with auto-empty dock)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock:</em></strong><em> No &#8211; just auto empty / <strong><em>Mop style:</em></strong><em> Vibrating pad / </em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> No / </em></em><strong><em>Mop pressure:</em></strong><em> 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute&nbsp;/ </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 5mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning:</em></strong><em> No / </em><strong><em>Mapping</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 6,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Dual rubber / </em><strong><em>Works with:</em></strong><em> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won’t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won’t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won’t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 wasn’t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock’s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that’s with its auto-empty dock.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9220.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 Plus adds an auto-empty dock to the robot vacuum&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9244.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 has a camera for navigation and obstacle detection.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9234.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It features an onboard water tank that you have to manually refill.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9230.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a flat mopping pad that vibrates to simulate scrubbing, excellent dual rubber roller brushes.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9235.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock has a dustbin but no water tanks.

It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn’t have any edge cleaning options, so it won’t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another great feature at this price is carpet sensing — the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you’re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-more-of-my-roborock-s8-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23846479/best-budget-robot-vacuum-robot-mop#:~:text=Best%20budget%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop\">Read more of my Roborock S8 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-midrange-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best midrange robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25349902/8A0A1063.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Good AI-powered obstacle detection</li><li>Effective mopping</li><li>Excellent value</li><li>Nice dock</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Single rubber / bristle brush</li><li>Lower suction power </li><li>No heated mop washing</li><li>Some navigation issues</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $599.99 at <strong>Amazon (with Prime)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eufy.com/products/t2351121?variant=44613959090362\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $599.99 at <strong>Eufy (with code WSPDV2UVOKD6)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eufy-x10-pro-omni-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-self-washing-and-self-drying-auto-empty-station-black/6576392.p\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock:</em></strong><em> Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / <strong><em>Mop style:</em></strong><em> Dual spinning pads / </em></em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes, hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM&nbsp;/ </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 12 mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning:</em></strong><em> Yes, swinging motion / </em><strong><em>Mapping</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 8,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Single rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with:</em></strong><em> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1065.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy is a large robot with a square-shaped front.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1070.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Its dual spinning mop pads are paired with a single rubber/bristle roller brush.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1073.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a removable washboard for easier cleaning.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1074.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The water tanks are easy to remove for refilling.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure.

It’s not quite as <span>effective as a mop&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, e</span>liminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Along with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1427.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The X40 Ultra has self-removable, dual spinning mopping pads.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1430.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Its washboard is also removable and has rotating wipers that clean out the area.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1420.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729498539469,100,78.541002921062\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The multifunction dock is tall but slimline and with a nice look&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas.

With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1434_8968b5.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy S1 has a unique “love it or hate it” look. I kind of love it.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3123.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy’s 11.4-inch roller brush extends almost the entire length of the front.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/IMG_3457.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.361925152446,100,39.276149695107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy has two spinning side brushes, which help get dirt into the bot’s path. &lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-for-tile-floors\">Best robot vacuum and mop for tile floors</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Narwal Freo Z Ultra</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3091.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Superb mopping</li><li>Great obstacle avoidance</li><li>Excellent dirt detection</li><li>Self-cleans its washboard</li><li>Very quiet</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Minimal mop lift</li><li>Edge cleaning just okay</li><li>Uses a lot of water</li><li>App is unreliable</li><li></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NARWAL-Avoidance-Real-Time-Decisions-Hot-Water/dp/B0D7HHKVLK\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $1299.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.narwal.com/products/narwal-freo-z-ultra-robot-vacuum-mop\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $1299.99 at <strong>Narwal (with code EPDZU)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/narwal-freo-z-ultra-robot-vacuum-grey/6599799.p?skuId=6599799\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $1299.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / <strong>Mop style: </strong>Dual triangular spinning pads / </em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes, hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop Pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 12mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, robot swing and fluffer / </em><strong><em>Mapping:</em></strong><em> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 12,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Narwal&#8217;s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner#best-robot-vacuum-mop-hybrid:~:text=empty%20its%20bin.-,Best%20mopping%20robot%20vacuum%20for%20hard%20floors,-8\">Freo X Ultra</a>, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3083.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A fluffy sidebrush and swinging motion help the bot clean along edges and baseboards.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3082.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Triangular-shaped mopping pads meet in the middle, meaning fewer missed spots.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that&#8217;s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237324/this-robot-vacuum-has-two-eyes-to-see-your-floors-better\">dual camera system</a> allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it&#8217;s clean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3092.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A control panel on the top provides quick access to control the robot.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3093.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock contains a dustbin, two water tanks, and a non-refillable proprietary cleaning solution.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a <em>lot</em> of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, its app can be frustrating. It&#8217;s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-a-plumbing-hookup\">Best robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>SwitchBot S10</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10260/8A0A1240.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Almost hands-free</li><li>Excellent roller mop</li><li>Self-cleans</li><li>Battery-powered water station</li><li>Supports Matter</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Big and wide</li><li>Can’t mop a second floor; it will only vacuum</li><li>Short battery life</li><li>Low suction power</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-floor-cleaning-robot-s10\"> <strike>$1199.99</strike> $499.99 at <strong>Switchbot (with code SYPT700)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Stations-Draining-Refilling-Hands-Free/dp/B0CSNB6TF8\"> <strike>$1199.99</strike> $623.99 at <strong>Amazon (at checkout)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / <strong>Mop style: </strong>Roller</em><strong> / <em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes (during use), hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop Pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 7mm /&nbsp; </em><strong><em>Edge cleaning</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> No / </em><strong><em>Mapping:</em></strong><em> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 6,500Pa / <strong>Vacuum b</strong></em><strong><em>rush style:</em></strong><em> Single rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23845579/switchbot-s10-robot-vacuum-mop-launch-ifa\">The SwitchBot S10</a> is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1219.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S10 is a very large and heavy robot.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1225.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a single rubber roller brush and a roller mop&lt;/em&gt;.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1252.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The roller mop is longer than the Deebot X8 but not as long as the Eufy S1.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1246.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It comes with two stations: a battery-powered water station that you hook to your plumbing …&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1239.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;… and an auto-empty station that requires power and also dries the mop.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot’s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats — which are the bane of most mopping bots</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn’t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">SwitchBot recently announced the SwitchBot S20 Pro, slated to launch this summer. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-full-switchbot-s10-review\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">Read my full SwitchBot S10 review</a>.</strong></h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"how-i-test-robot-vacuums\">How I test robot vacuums</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">I’ve been testing robot vacuums for 6 years and have tested over 60 models.

For specific tests, I deploy a wet and dry challenge. The wet challenge features dried-on OJ and ketchup, plus fresh spills of milk, water, and some kind of sauce. For the dry challenge, I place cereal (usually Cheerios) and oatmeal (a really tough one to clean). I evaluate how well the bots deal with mopping the stains and vacuuming the debris.<br><br>Finally, I test their obstacle detection by running them through an obstacle course featuring common robot trip-ups, including fake dog poop, cables, socks, and tricky chair legs.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-i-m-currently-testing-and-what-s-coming-next\">What I’m currently testing and what’s coming next</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/IMG_1975.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Narwal’s upcoming Narwal Flow features a big and wide extendable roller mop.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>As mentioned before, Ecovacs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665607/the-latest-ecovacs-vacuum-sounds-like-a-blast\">recently released a successor</a> to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($<a href=\"https://www.ecovacs.com/us/deebot-robotic-vacuum-cleaner/deebot-x9-pro-omni\">1,599.99</a>).

While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.\nThe difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\n\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier \n\n\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor sweeping bots. \nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week. \nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board. \nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do, yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier. \nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Deebot X8 Pro Omni\nThe Deebot X8 Pro Omni is an excellent roller mopping bot that extends to clean along backboards and furniture. It’s also a powerful vacuum with great obstacle avoidance, a small dock, and a convenient self-cleaning brush system.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 at Amazon\n $1399.99 at Evovacs\n\nBest on a budget: Roborock S8 Plus\nRoborock’s S8 robot vacuum / mop offers a host of high-end features at an affordable price, including 6,000Pa of suction,  AI-powered obstacle detection, and dual rubber roller brushes that perform well on carpet.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $749.99 $399.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $519.99 at Amazon (with auto-empty dock)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nHow I test robot vacuums\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nDeebot X8 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-cleaning roller mop\nExtendable mop\nExcellent obstacle avoidance\nSmaller dock\n\nLimited mop lift\nHeavy, struggles with transitions\nSingle roller brush\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 at Amazon\n $1399.99 at Ecovacs\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /  Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter support promised\nEcovacs’ Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop. \nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops). At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\n\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested\n\n\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It’s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it’s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\n\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\n\n\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn’t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can’t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else. \nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nRoborock S8 Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSonic-mopping\nAuto-mop lift\nAI-powered obstacle avoidance\nDual-rubber roller brushes\nCarpet detection\n\nVery large and wide\nHave to wash the mop manually\nHave to refill the water tank manually\nNo heated drying\nLimited mop lift\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $749.99 $399.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $519.99 at Amazon (with auto-empty dock)\n\nMultifunction Dock: No – just auto empty / Mop style: Vibrating pad / Mop washing: No / Mop pressure: 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute / Mop lift: Yes, 5mm / Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won’t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors. \nUnlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won’t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won’t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.\nThe S8 wasn’t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock’s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that’s with its auto-empty dock.\nOne of my favorite features of the S8 is that it can be set to mop only, and it does an excellent job, moving in a tighter “Z” pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn’t have any edge cleaning options, so it won’t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.\nAnother great feature at this price is carpet sensing — the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.\nThe S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you’re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.\nRead more of my Roborock S8 review.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $599.99 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $799.99 $599.99 at Eufy (with code WSPDV2UVOKD6)\n $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range. \nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. \nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $899.99 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $1499.99 $899.99 at Dreame (with code EBX40U)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown  / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It’s not quite as effective as a mop or vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn’t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I’m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nEufy Omni S1 Pro\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLong roller mop\nSleek, futuristic design\nDual side brushes\nSquare shape helps with corners\n\nMiddling vacuum performance\nNo self-cleaning base\nNo mop extension\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $799.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2071111)\n $1299.99 at Amazon\n $1299.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /  Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless. \nI found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables. \nThe S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove. \n\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\n\n\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them. \nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer. \nThe S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines. \nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nNarwal Freo Z Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSuperb mopping\nGreat obstacle avoidance\nExcellent dirt detection\nSelf-cleans its washboard\nVery quiet\n\nMinimal mop lift\nEdge cleaning just okay\nUses a lot of water\nApp is unreliable\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $1299.99 at Amazon\n $1499.99 $1299.99 at Narwal (with code EPDZU)\n $1499.99 $1299.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal’s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\n\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\n\n\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that’s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it’s clean. \n\n\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.  \nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It’s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all. \nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nSwitchBot S10\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAlmost hands-free\nExcellent roller mop\nSelf-cleans\nBattery-powered water station\nSupports Matter\n\nBig and wide\nCan’t mop a second floor; it will only vacuum\nShort battery life\nLow suction power\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $499.99 at Switchbot (with code SYPT700)\n $1199.99 $623.99 at Amazon (at checkout)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /  Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot’s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\n\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats — which are the bane of most mopping bots\n\n\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn’t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently announced the SwitchBot S20 Pro, slated to launch this summer. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nHow I test robot vacuums\nI’ve been testing robot vacuums for 6 years and have tested over 60 models. I write The Verge’s Best robot vacuum buying guide and the Best budget robot vacuum guide, and for this guide, I tested 15 different mopping robots.\nTo evaluate the bots, I ran each regularly for at least a week and measured their progress, evaluating how clean the floor stays, how well they navigate, how often I had to refill the tanks, how well the auto-empty function worked, and how easy the app was to use.\nI run them in my kitchen, where I have hardwood floors, and in a large bathroom with a white tile floor — one that looks filthy just a day after being cleaned. For specific tests, I deploy a wet and dry challenge. The wet challenge features dried-on OJ and ketchup, plus fresh spills of milk, water, and some kind of sauce. For the dry challenge, I place cereal (usually Cheerios) and oatmeal (a really tough one to clean). I evaluate how well the bots deal with mopping the stains and vacuuming the debris.\nFinally, I test their obstacle detection by running them through an obstacle course featuring common robot trip-ups, including fake dog poop, cables, socks, and tricky chair legs.\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\nAs mentioned before, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($1,599.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven’t put it through its paces yet.\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($2,599), the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up light objects — including socks, tissues, and sandals. The arm isn’t the most reliable, and the vacuum occasionally struggles with correctly identifying items, but it’s otherwise an excellent model with 22,000Pa of suction power and dual spinning mop pads that it can remove on its own. Read our review.\nRoborock’s cheaper Qrevo Curv ($1,299.99 $1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company’s Qrevo Slim ($1,099.99 $1,399.99) offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock ($999.99) also offers heated mop drying, a feature the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max lacks.\nPriced at $999.99, Eufy’s new Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum with a rolling mop that can go over tough stains a second time if needed. The charging dock also includes a built-in deep cleaner that sprays water to tackle stains before sucking the mess into a separate wastewater tank.\nThe Narwal Flow sports the brand’s first roller mop, which can also extend. Narwal claims it can tackle thick, fluffy carpets with a deep carpet boost mode and is scheduled to arrive in August at an undisclosed price.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry. Here’s some video of it in action.\nEureka’s J20 ($899.99 $1,099.99 ) features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction. The forthcoming J15 Max Ultra ($1,299) can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It’s an upgrade to the J15 Pro Ultra ($799.99 $999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,299.99 $1,699.99) features a “motorized swing arm” that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe Switchbot S20 ($799.99), which resembles the Pro model announced at CES earlier this year, is now available for preorder ahead of its release date in early August. It’s essentially the successor to our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum, the Switchbot S10, with an extendable roller mop / side brush and 15,000Pa of suction power.\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum mop ($649.99 $999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions. Its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags.\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, July 3rd: Adjusted pricing / availability and added details on the Switchbot S20 and Narwal Flow.

It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything. The 13-inch model starts with 16GB of RAM at $999, and it also comes in a 15-inch version for $1,199, for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis, especially at these prices.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future\">Despite losing its way around the mid-2010s</a>, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M4 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, and MagSafe charging, check. Those were also true on the previous models, but now with the M4 generation it also features the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam of the MacBook Pros, can use two external monitors with its lid open, and comes in a sky blue color (though it still looks silver in some light). And again, you get all this for <em>less</em> money than before. </p>\n\n<p>The M4 Air is a great option for just about anyone who doesn’t need video editing, heavy gaming, or more than two USB-C ports. For those that do, look to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\">14-inch MacBook Pro M4</a> — a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599. Opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port, an SD card slot, and an even better screen.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air M4 is the best laptop of 2024.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now that the M4 Air is here, Apple has fully discontinued the M3 and M2 models. You might still be able to find them at retailers like <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6602763.p?skuId=6602763\">Best Buy</a>, but they’re not worth it over the M4 unless substantially discounted. If you can afford an additional $200 on top of either the 13- or 15-inch M4 Air’s starting prices, that’ll net you 512GB of storage instead of 256GB — as well as the 10-core GPU on the 13-inch. The paltry base storage is the only remaining weak point of the MacBook Air. It’s definitely worth getting more, as the roomier SSD will make your life a little easier on a laptop that should easily last you five to seven (or even more) years.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple MacBook Air 15 (2025, M4)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0183.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Easily lasts a full day on battery</li><li>Excellent choice for most people’s everyday needs</li><li>Nails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to be</li><li>Louder speakers over its smaller counterpart</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Still starts with just 256GB of storage</li><li>Still has limited ports</li><li>Still prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDBDCFH/\"> <strike>$1199</strike> $1049 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6565869.p\"> <strike>$1199</strike> $1049 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/kOM4Rz\"> $1199 at <strong>Apple</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kkIPG4\">Read our review of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review\">Apple MacBook Air M4</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Op71aj\">Best Chromebook</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 (2024)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Acer’s Spin Chromebook is configured with Intel’s first generation of processor with an NPU.

Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air, and the Surface Laptop mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. It’s the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night. And if your budget is slightly tighter, there’s a new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/671554/microsoft-surface-laptop-13-inch-review\">13-inch model</a> with pared-down features starting at $899 that’s still really good.</p>\n\n<p>The greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is whether Windows on Arm supports all the apps you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there can still be some outliers, especially in content creation apps. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam and they can’t install games from Microsoft’s own Xbox app — just stream them if your subscribe to PC Game Pass.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/601205/microsoft-surface-pro-11-surface-laptop-7-intel-lunar-lake-release-date-pricing\">launched Intel Lunar Lake- based versions</a> of the Surface Laptop 7, but they’re a ridiculous $500 more expensive, and aimed solely at businesses. It’s a shame, because having this hardware with Lunar Lake’s compatibility might have been an appealing prospect. </p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"read-our-review-of-the-13-8-inch-microsoft-surface-laptop-7th-edition\">Read our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185462/microsoft-surface-laptop-7th-edition-review\">review</a> of the 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"foIiCi\">The best 16-inch Windows laptop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Asus Zenbook S 16</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25561955/247213_Asus_Zenbook_S16_JNelius_0004.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"An open and powered on laptop against a background of blue and purple squares.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>It’s gorgeous</li><li>Incredibly thin and light for a 16-inch laptop</li><li>Great performance, especially the integrated graphics</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Shorter battery life than major competitors</li><li>StoryCube doesn’t work</li><li>Couldn’t get a sense of how fast the NPU really is</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-zenbook-s-16-16-3k-oled-touch-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370-32gb-memory-1tb-ssd-zumaia-gray/6593255.p\"> <strike>$1799.99</strike> $1399.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&#038;xs=1&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nb13m3-m00790-asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606.html\"> <strike>$1799.99</strike> $1774.99 at <strong>Asus (with code ASUS25TODAY)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><sub><em><strong>CPU: </strong>AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 /</em> <em><strong>GPU:</strong> Radeon 890M, Radeon 880M&nbsp; / <strong>RAM: </strong>32GB, 24GB / <strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB / <strong>Display: </strong>touch 16-inch 2880 x 1800, 120Hz OLED with stylus support, 500 nits peak HDR / <strong>Dimensions: </strong>13.92 x 9.57 x 0.47 ~ 0.51 inches<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Weight: </strong>3.21 pounds </em></sub></em></p>\n\n<p>The 16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 is the best-looking, best-performing Windows laptop we’ve tested recently; it’s also so thin and lightweight you wouldn’t know it just by holding it! It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.</p>\n\n<p>There are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,800 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)</p>\n\n<p>At just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff.

From what I’ve seen so far, the 5080 is the sweet spot for high-end gaming laptops in this generation. The 5080 ROG Strix Scar is within earshot of the 5090 performance I saw in the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/649577/razer-blade-16-2025-rtx-5090-review\">Razer Blade 16</a>, and it’s $1,200 cheaper. The Asus is chunky and heavy compared to Razer’s svelte Blade, but that gives its GPU the space it needs to stay cool. Thinner laptops often thermally constrain a high-end chip like the 5090.</p>\n\n<p>The ROG Strix Scar doesn’t have an OLED display like its direct competitors, which is indeed a bummer, but its 2560 x 1600 240Hz Mini LED panel is still sharp and bright, with some punchy colors. The 16-inch version of the Strix Scar eschews a number pad, giving its large keycaps plenty of space so typing isn’t cramped at all. Its trackpad is massive, and it houses a hidden touch-sensitive numpad you can call up with a long-press in the top corner — though it’s more useful for data entry than gaming needs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Strix Scar’s boisterous RGB light show is kind of fun in its garishness.

Both the 14- and 16-inch models are available with powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max processors. There’s also a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\">14-inch Pro with a standard M4 processor</a>, and while it’s a formidable step up from the MacBook Air as an everyman’s “pro” laptop, the M4 Pro and Max processors still outclass it in performance.</p>\n\n<p>Processors aside, the MacBook Pro has remained largely unchanged since 2021. It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 16-inch, but aside from the very lowest processor options, most configurations are available in either size, so pick whichever works for you.</p>\n\n<p>In our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The top-of-the-line <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs\">16-inch M4 Max model</a> easily lasted all day in our most recent testing, with no battery-saving features enabled and even keeping the screen on full-time.</p>\n\n<p>Most people who need much more power than a MacBook Air — including all but the most demanding pro photographers — will be fine with an M4 Pro model, which starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD. The M4 Pro chip can be configured with up to 48GB of memory and a 4TB SSD, at the usual absurd Apple markups, and it supports up to two external 6K displays.</p>\n\n<p>If you absolutely need more GPU power — or more than two external monitors — you can step up to the M4 Max. The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors. The vast majority of people don’t have workloads heavy enough to notice a significant difference between the M4 Pro and M4 Max; if you do, you probably know it.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>14-inch MacBook Pro with M4</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25718368/247372_MacBook_Pro_M4_ADiBenedetto_0007.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 laptop on a wooden cafe counter near a window.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Everything good about last year’s model but better</li><li>All the I/O of the pricier MacBook Pros</li><li>More RAM</li><li>New webcam is sharp and clear</li><li>Nano-texture display is a nice add-on</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Desk View webcam feature is low-res and overly distorted</li><li>Space black finish can still be a little smudgy</li><li>Apple’s price structure may still have you longing for M4 Pro / Max</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-Laptop-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLHBYRPS\"> <strike>$1599</strike> $1429 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-black/6602741.p\"> <strike>$1599</strike> $1429 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859560-REG/apple_mw2u3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html\"> <strike>$1599</strike> $1499 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"I5LPMh\">Read our reviews of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs\">MacBook Pro 16 M4 Pro / Max</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\">MacBook Pro 14 M4</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"jWmMLL\">The best 14-inch gaming laptop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/rogzeyphg14_solo.webp?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Balanced performance, battery life, and portability</li><li>OLED display</li><li>Programmable LED strip on the lid</li><li>Great keyboard and smooth trackpad</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Gets a bit hot and loud under load</li><li>Soldered RAM</li><li>Thermally throttles its GPUs</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/\"> $1799.99 at <strong>Asus</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-270-16gb-lpddr5x-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white/6629420.p\"> $1799.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><sub><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9 270, HX 370 / <strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, RTX 5070, RTX 5070 TI, RTX 5080 / <strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB, 32GB / <strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB / <strong>Display:</strong> 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz, 500 nits / <strong>Dimensions: </strong>12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 inches / <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.31 pounds</sub></em></em></p>\n\n<p>Asus recently introduced an updated ROG Zephyrus G14 for 2025, which replaces the previous model as our pick for the best 14-inch gaming laptop. It retains the sleek design Asus <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison\">introduced last year</a> and continues to strike a balance between power and portability; it also incorporates a handful of improvements, some of which have allowed it to earn the top spot in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop\">best gaming laptops guide</a>, despite a $100 price bump. </p>\n\n<p>The updated Zephyrus G14 has a newer AMD 9-series processor and Nvidia RTX 50-series graphics chip, which provide modest performance gains. Every configuration features a handsome, high-res OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, so smoother gameplay isn’t locked behind an optional upgrade. Conveniently, the new G14 features USB-C ports on both sides for charging, although you’ll still achieve the maximum wattage by using Asus’ proprietary charger. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The G14 features a backlit, chiclet-style keyboard, and Asus has increased the keycap size by 12.24 percent to make them easier to press. The centered trackpad is also relatively wide, providing ample space for clicks, taps, and swipes without cramping your hand. These features are as useful for typing and productivity work as they are for playing games when you’re not connected to a gaming keyboard and mouse. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speaking of games, the titles we played ran well, even on high settings, but the laptop felt hot to the touch due to its thin chassis. Its fans were audible under heavy load, and the laptop eventually thermally throttled its GPUs to prevent overheating. The tradeoffs aren’t surprising, though, especially given the G14’s thin, lightweight design.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gKwA2i\">The best dual-screen laptop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Lenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24773689/236717_Lenovo_Yoga_Book_9i_DSeifert_0006.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Lenovo Yoga Book 9i laptop with two screens open.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Bold design</li><li>Great speakers for their size</li><li>Included stylus and mouse</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Awkward to put away</li><li>Few ports</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://howl.link/qfzhe46wh3ewq\"> $1999.99 at <strong>Lenovo</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-yoga-book-9i-2-in-1-13-3-2-8k-dual-screen-oled-touchscreen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-155u-with-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-tidal-teal/6571365.p\"> $1999.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><sub><strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core Ultra 7 155U / <strong>GPU: </strong>Intel UHD (integrated) / <strong>RAM: </strong>16GB LPDDR5X / <strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD / <strong>Display:</strong> 13.3-inch (2880 x 1800) 60Hz OLED touchscreen w/ stylus support / <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.78 x 8.03 x 0.63 inches / <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.95 pounds</sub></em></em></p>\n\n<p>A dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes.</p>\n\n<p>The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. You can set it up at home with an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement, or take it on the go with the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.</p>\n\n<p>The Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"VD48f8\">Read our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24140334/asus-zenbook-duo-vs-lenovo-yoga-book-9i\">head-to-head review</a> of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i and the Asus Zenbook Duo.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"T7rFe5\">The best repairable laptop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Framework Laptop 13 (2025, AMD Ryzen AI 7 350)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257702_Framework_Laptop_13_AMD_2025_ADiBenedetto_0001.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Still the repairability champ with excellent, modular port selection</li><li>Faster CPU performance over both Intel and previous AMD models</li><li>High-res 3:2 aspect ratio screen is great for productivity</li><li>Thin, light, and an overall great package</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Radeon 860M iGPU performance is a little lacking</li><li>Trackpad still feels a little cheap</li><li>Screen is a little lacking in contrast and color quality</li><li>Less repairable laptops offer more for similar prices or less</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-amd-ai300/configuration/new\"> $899 at <strong>Framework</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><sub><em><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen AI 5 340</em>,  AI 7 350, AI 9 HX 370 <em><em>/ <strong>GPU: </strong>Radeon 860M / <strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, 48GB, 96GB / <strong>Storage:</strong> 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / <strong>Display:</strong> 13.5 inch IPS, 2256 x 1504 60Hz or 2880 x 1920 120Hz, no touch option / <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches / <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.87 pounds</em></em></sub></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s no other laptop offering the kind of nerdy fun today that a Framework is. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300\">Framework Laptop 13</a> isn’t just the only game in town when it comes to a notebook that’s fully repairable and upgradeable, it’s also a great productivity machine for everyday use and has been for several years now. For 2025, the Laptop 13 gets a processor upgrade with AMD’s “Strix Point” Ryzen AI chips, giving it higher performance than the last-gen Intel and AMD offerings with serviceable battery life. Otherwise, it’s much the same chassis as the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23911664/framework-laptop-13-2023-amd-review\">prior generation</a> — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300#:~:text=The%20new%20AMD%20Framework%2013%20atop%20the%20last%2Dgen%20AMD%20and%20Intel%20models.%20If%20not%20for%20the%20orange%20USB%2DC%20port%20even%20I%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20be%20able%20to%20tell%20them%20apart.\">they’re indistinguishable</a> from one another.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that’s part of what’s so cool about a Framework: a new model means a new chip you can even put into the <em>old </em>model, if you want an upgrade and don’t mind opening up the chassis yourself. It’s actually much easier to do than you may fear, as Framework designs its laptops to give you full access to everything inside with just a simple screwdriver; including its mainboard, storage, RAM, battery, and some fun see-through bezels for a touch of customization. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you opt for one of Framework’s DIY Editions it only comes partially built, but this allows you to choose from many more configuration options than its pre-builts. Personally, I think the DIY route is the way to go if you’re up for it, because experiencing the assembly (which took me less than 30 minutes) gives you a better awareness of what’s in your laptop and how to change something if you ever need to repair or upgrade it. But even if you choose a pre-built, you can pick from a wide array of modular ports to outfit it with.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257702_Framework_Laptop_13_AMD_2025_ADiBenedetto_0035.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It’s a simple design, but when it comes to repairability and modularity there’s nothing quite like it.

It’s thin enough and light enough to be very portable, and it’s got a great keyboard with a fine trackpad. Its screen has a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for productivity since you can see a bit more than the more typical 16:10.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You probably have to be really into the whole repairability and modularity concept to spend the same or more on a Framework Laptop 13 compared to other options out there, but anyone can appreciate picking your ports and being able to swap them around whenever you want.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cPtIn9\">Read our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/650608/framework-laptop-13-review-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300\">Framework Laptop 13 (2025) review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’re currently testing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/690885/google-chromeos-gemini-ai-select-to-search-lenovo-chromebook-plus-14\">Lenovo’s recently announced Chromebook Plus</a>.

We review and test a wide swath of them here at The Verge, and we’re constantly considering what’s the best and who it’s best for.\nOur overall pick for most people has been, and continues to be, the MacBook Air — particularly, as of March 2025, the M4 model. Unless you’re forced to use Windows for specific software needs or you fancy yourself a hardcore gamer, it remains the best option for the average user who wants something portable with excellent battery life and great performance for productivity tasks.\nThough the MacBook Air is the easy recommendation for most people, that doesn’t make it the answer for everyone. What if you need more power for video or photo editing, or crunching large datasets? What if you prefer to run Windows? What if you play lots of games and want to take them with you? Or what if you just want something unique — or even, gasp, repairable?

The 13-inch model starts with 16GB of RAM at $999, and it also comes in a 15-inch version for $1,199, for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis, especially at these prices.\nDespite losing its way around the mid-2010s, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M4 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, and MagSafe charging, check. Those were also true on the previous models, but now with the M4 generation it also features the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam of the MacBook Pros, can use two external monitors with its lid open, and comes in a sky blue color (though it still looks silver in some light). And again, you get all this for less money than before. \nThe M4 Air is a great option for just about anyone who doesn’t need video editing, heavy gaming, or more than two USB-C ports. For those that do, look to the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 — a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599. Opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port, an SD card slot, and an even better screen.\nNow that the M4 Air is here, Apple has fully discontinued the M3 and M2 models. You might still be able to find them at retailers like Best Buy, but they’re not worth it over the M4 unless substantially discounted. If you can afford an additional $200 on top of either the 13- or 15-inch M4 Air’s starting prices, that’ll net you 512GB of storage instead of 256GB — as well as the 10-core GPU on the 13-inch. The paltry base storage is the only remaining weak point of the MacBook Air. It’s definitely worth getting more, as the roomier SSD will make your life a little easier on a laptop that should easily last you five to seven (or even more) years.\nApple MacBook Air 15 (2025, M4)\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEasily lasts a full day on battery\nExcellent choice for most people’s everyday needs\nNails the basics in a thin-and-light while feeling like a nice place to be\nLouder speakers over its smaller counterpart\n\nStill starts with just 256GB of storage\nStill has limited ports\nStill prone to throttling under heavy creative tasks\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 $1049 at Amazon\n $1199 $1049 at Best Buy\n $1199 at Apple\n\nRead our review of the Apple MacBook Air M4.\nBest Chromebook\nAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 (2024)\nAcer’s Spin Chromebook is configured with Intel’s first generation of processor with an NPU. It also has Google Gemini baked right into the OS, and if you sign up for a new Google One AI premium plan, your first year of service is free. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699 $629 at Best Buy\n\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 5 115U / GPU: Intel UHD / RAM: 8GB, 16GB LPDDR5 / Storage: 256GB, 512GB / Display: Touch 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1200, 60Hz IPS with stylus support, 340 nits / Dimensions: 12.35 x 8.84 x 0.71 inches / Weight: 3.21 pounds \nAcer’s Chromebook Spin is the best Chromebook we saw in 2024 — and was part of the last year’s Plus line of Chromebooks, which have Google Gemini features integrated with ChromeOS. It also comes with a 12-month subscription to the Google One AI premium plan, which includes 2TB of cloud storage space and access to Gemini Advanced.\nThe Core Ultra 5 115U is slower than the previous gen’s Intel Core i5-1335U (the Ultra has eight cores with clock speeds up to 4.20GHz, while the Core i5 has 10 cores and goes up to 4.60GHz), but the Ultra Core has an NPU, which means it’s better suited for running AI-related tasks on-device. This Spin Chromebook also supports the current LPDDR5 memory standard, which is faster than the previous generation in the 2023 Spin 714.\nAcer upgraded some of the connectivity port options, too. The Spin 714 now has two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, instead of two USB-C 3.2 ports, for much faster data transfer and power delivery. \nBest Snapdragon X laptop\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (13.8-inch)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAll-day battery life\nGreat performance for most apps\n16GB of RAM for the base model\n\nGame support is limited\nAI features feel gimmicky\nEmulated apps can hit battery and performance\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $879.99 at Amazon (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1099.99 at Microsoft (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nCPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus X1P-64-100, Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100 / GPU: Qualcomm Adreno / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB LPDDR5X (soldered) / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB / Display: 13.8-inch touchscreen LCD, 2304 x 1536 120Hz, 600 nits / Dimensions: 11.85 x 8.67 x 0.69 inches / Weight: 2.96 pounds\nOut of all the Snapdragon Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested so far, the 13.8- and 15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th edition stood out for their balance of performance, exceptional battery life and standby time, and quality components (120Hz screen, keyboard, webcam, trackpad, etc.). Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air, and the Surface Laptop mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. It’s the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night. And if your budget is slightly tighter, there’s a new 13-inch model with pared-down features starting at $899 that’s still really good.\nThe greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is whether Windows on Arm supports all the apps you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there can still be some outliers, especially in content creation apps. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam and they can’t install games from Microsoft’s own Xbox app — just stream them if your subscribe to PC Game Pass.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft launched Intel Lunar Lake- based versions of the Surface Laptop 7, but they’re a ridiculous $500 more expensive, and aimed solely at businesses. It’s a shame, because having this hardware with Lunar Lake’s compatibility might have been an appealing prospect. \nRead our review of the 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition.\nThe best 16-inch Windows laptop\nAsus Zenbook S 16\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nIt’s gorgeous\nIncredibly thin and light for a 16-inch laptop\nGreat performance, especially the integrated graphics\n\nShorter battery life than major competitors\nStoryCube doesn’t work\nCouldn’t get a sense of how fast the NPU really is\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1399.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $1774.99 at Asus (with code ASUS25TODAY)\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 / GPU: Radeon 890M, Radeon 880M  / RAM: 32GB, 24GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: touch 16-inch 2880 x 1800, 120Hz OLED with stylus support, 500 nits peak HDR / Dimensions: 13.92 x 9.57 x 0.47 ~ 0.51 inches / Weight: 3.21 pounds \nThe 16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 is the best-looking, best-performing Windows laptop we’ve tested recently; it’s also so thin and lightweight you wouldn’t know it just by holding it! It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.\nThere are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,800 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)\nAt just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff. There’s still no other Windows laptop that offers as much performance and versatility in a 16-inch chassis for the price.\nRead our review of the Asus Zenbook S 16.\nThe best laptop for high-end gaming\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat graphics performance in the latest high-end games\nLots of ports and easy access to RAM / SSDs\nAnimated lid and wraparound RGB are fun\nVery good QHD / 240Hz Mini LED screen\n\nTypical gaming laptop issues (pricey, hefty, and not great battery life)\nCompetition offers OLED screens\nCustomizing lid animations is a pain\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3299.99 at Asus\n $3299.99 at Amazon\n\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 / RAM: 32GB / Storage: 2TB / Display: 16-inch Mini LED 2560 x 1600, 240Hz display / Dimensions: 13.94 x 10.55 x 0.9 to 1.21 inches / Weight: 6.17 pounds\nI’m still testing a handful of different gaming laptops, including the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 and HP Omen Max 16, but the frontrunner so far (by a nose) is the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 with an Nvidia RTX 5080 GPU. From what I’ve seen so far, the 5080 is the sweet spot for high-end gaming laptops in this generation. The 5080 ROG Strix Scar is within earshot of the 5090 performance I saw in the new Razer Blade 16, and it’s $1,200 cheaper. The Asus is chunky and heavy compared to Razer’s svelte Blade, but that gives its GPU the space it needs to stay cool. Thinner laptops often thermally constrain a high-end chip like the 5090.\nThe ROG Strix Scar doesn’t have an OLED display like its direct competitors, which is indeed a bummer, but its 2560 x 1600 240Hz Mini LED panel is still sharp and bright, with some punchy colors. The 16-inch version of the Strix Scar eschews a number pad, giving its large keycaps plenty of space so typing isn’t cramped at all. Its trackpad is massive, and it houses a hidden touch-sensitive numpad you can call up with a long-press in the top corner — though it’s more useful for data entry than gaming needs.\nThe Strix Scar’s boisterous RGB light show is kind of fun in its garishness. In addition to wraparound underglow, it has a dot-matrix array of LEDs on its lid to display animations — as Asus has done before. A more useful feature is the way you can open up the laptop’s bottom plate like the hood of a car for easy, tool-free access to its two RAM slots and SSDs.\nThe best MacBook for photo and video editing\nApple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro / Max, 16-inch)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBlazing speed\nExcellent battery life\nRarely gets very hot or loud\nMore base RAM, Thunderbolt 5, great webcam, and anti-glare screen option\n\nPricey\nShame it’s got all those GPU cores and Macs still struggle with games\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2249 at Amazon (M4 Pro)\n $2499 $2249 at Best Buy (M4 Pro)\n $3499 $3149 at Amazon (M4 Max)\n\nCPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / GPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / RAM: 24GB or 48GB (M4 Pro),  36GB – 128 GB (M4 Max) / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 14.2 / 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR, 3024 x 1964 / 3456 x 2234, adaptive refresh up to 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 (14-inch) / 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (16-inch) / Weight: 3.5 / 4.7 pounds (M4 Pro), 3.6 / 4.8 pounds (M4 Max) \nIf you need power for intensive creative work — like 3D rendering and working with ultra-high-resolution photos and video — the MacBook Pro is your best bet. Both the 14- and 16-inch models are available with powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max processors. There’s also a 14-inch Pro with a standard M4 processor, and while it’s a formidable step up from the MacBook Air as an everyman’s “pro” laptop, the M4 Pro and Max processors still outclass it in performance.\nProcessors aside, the MacBook Pro has remained largely unchanged since 2021. It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 16-inch, but aside from the very lowest processor options, most configurations are available in either size, so pick whichever works for you.\nIn our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The top-of-the-line 16-inch M4 Max model easily lasted all day in our most recent testing, with no battery-saving features enabled and even keeping the screen on full-time.\nMost people who need much more power than a MacBook Air — including all but the most demanding pro photographers — will be fine with an M4 Pro model, which starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD. The M4 Pro chip can be configured with up to 48GB of memory and a 4TB SSD, at the usual absurd Apple markups, and it supports up to two external 6K displays.\nIf you absolutely need more GPU power — or more than two external monitors — you can step up to the M4 Max. The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors. The vast majority of people don’t have workloads heavy enough to notice a significant difference between the M4 Pro and M4 Max; if you do, you probably know it.\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nEverything good about last year’s model but better\nAll the I/O of the pricier MacBook Pros\nMore RAM\nNew webcam is sharp and clear\nNano-texture display is a nice add-on\n\nDesk View webcam feature is low-res and overly distorted\nSpace black finish can still be a little smudgy\nApple’s price structure may still have you longing for M4 Pro / Max\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1429 at Amazon\n $1599 $1429 at Best Buy\n $1599 $1499 at B&H Photo\n\nRead our reviews of the MacBook Pro 16 M4 Pro / Max and MacBook Pro 14 M4.\nThe best 14-inch gaming laptop\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBalanced performance, battery life, and portability\nOLED display\nProgrammable LED strip on the lid\nGreat keyboard and smooth trackpad\n\nGets a bit hot and loud under load\nSoldered RAM\nThermally throttles its GPUs\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 at Asus\n $1799.99 at Best Buy\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 270, HX 370 / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, RTX 5070, RTX 5070 TI, RTX 5080 / RAM: 16GB, 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz, 500 nits / Dimensions: 12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 3.31 pounds\nAsus recently introduced an updated ROG Zephyrus G14 for 2025, which replaces the previous model as our pick for the best 14-inch gaming laptop. It retains the sleek design Asus introduced last year and continues to strike a balance between power and portability; it also incorporates a handful of improvements, some of which have allowed it to earn the top spot in our best gaming laptops guide, despite a $100 price bump. \nThe updated Zephyrus G14 has a newer AMD 9-series processor and Nvidia RTX 50-series graphics chip, which provide modest performance gains. Every configuration features a handsome, high-res OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, so smoother gameplay isn’t locked behind an optional upgrade. Conveniently, the new G14 features USB-C ports on both sides for charging, although you’ll still achieve the maximum wattage by using Asus’ proprietary charger. \nThe G14 features a backlit, chiclet-style keyboard, and Asus has increased the keycap size by 12.24 percent to make them easier to press. The centered trackpad is also relatively wide, providing ample space for clicks, taps, and swipes without cramping your hand. These features are as useful for typing and productivity work as they are for playing games when you’re not connected to a gaming keyboard and mouse. \nSpeaking of games, the titles we played ran well, even on high settings, but the laptop felt hot to the touch due to its thin chassis. Its fans were audible under heavy load, and the laptop eventually thermally throttled its GPUs to prevent overheating. The tradeoffs aren’t surprising, though, especially given the G14’s thin, lightweight design.\nThe best dual-screen laptop\nLenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBold design\nGreat speakers for their size\nIncluded stylus and mouse\n\nAwkward to put away\nFew ports\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1999.99 at Lenovo\n $1999.99 at Best Buy\n\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 155U / GPU: Intel UHD (integrated) / RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X / Storage: 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD / Display: 13.3-inch (2880 x 1800) 60Hz OLED touchscreen w/ stylus support / Dimensions: 11.78 x 8.03 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 2.95 pounds\nA dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes.\nThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. You can set it up at home with an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement, or take it on the go with the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.\nThe Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.\nRead our head-to-head review of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i and the Asus Zenbook Duo.\nThe best repairable laptop\nFramework Laptop 13 (2025, AMD Ryzen AI 7 350)\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nStill the repairability champ with excellent, modular port selection\nFaster CPU performance over both Intel and previous AMD models\nHigh-res 3:2 aspect ratio screen is great for productivity\nThin, light, and an overall great package\n\nRadeon 860M iGPU performance is a little lacking\nTrackpad still feels a little cheap\nScreen is a little lacking in contrast and color quality\nLess repairable laptops offer more for similar prices or less\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899 at Framework\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 5 340,  AI 7 350, AI 9 HX 370 / GPU: Radeon 860M / RAM: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, 48GB, 96GB / Storage: 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 13.5 inch IPS, 2256 x 1504 60Hz or 2880 x 1920 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches / Weight: 2.87 pounds\nThere’s no other laptop offering the kind of nerdy fun today that a Framework is. The Framework Laptop 13 isn’t just the only game in town when it comes to a notebook that’s fully repairable and upgradeable, it’s also a great productivity machine for everyday use and has been for several years now. For 2025, the Laptop 13 gets a processor upgrade with AMD’s “Strix Point” Ryzen AI chips, giving it higher performance than the last-gen Intel and AMD offerings with serviceable battery life. Otherwise, it’s much the same chassis as the prior generation — they’re indistinguishable from one another.\nBut that’s part of what’s so cool about a Framework: a new model means a new chip you can even put into the old model, if you want an upgrade and don’t mind opening up the chassis yourself. It’s actually much easier to do than you may fear, as Framework designs its laptops to give you full access to everything inside with just a simple screwdriver; including its mainboard, storage, RAM, battery, and some fun see-through bezels for a touch of customization. \nIf you opt for one of Framework’s DIY Editions it only comes partially built, but this allows you to choose from many more configuration options than its pre-builts. Personally, I think the DIY route is the way to go if you’re up for it, because experiencing the assembly (which took me less than 30 minutes) gives you a better awareness of what’s in your laptop and how to change something if you ever need to repair or upgrade it. But even if you choose a pre-built, you can pick from a wide array of modular ports to outfit it with.\nThe Laptop 13 isn’t as sleek as a similarly priced MacBook or Surface, which offer no upgradeability or modularity (aside from the SSD on some Surface Laptops), but the Framework by no means feels cheap. It’s thin enough and light enough to be very portable, and it’s got a great keyboard with a fine trackpad. Its screen has a 3:2 aspect ratio that’s ideal for productivity since you can see a bit more than the more typical 16:10.\nYou probably have to be really into the whole repairability and modularity concept to spend the same or more on a Framework Laptop 13 compared to other options out there, but anyone can appreciate picking your ports and being able to swap them around whenever you want.\nRead our Framework Laptop 13 (2025) review.\nWhat’s coming next\nWe’re currently testing Lenovo’s recently announced Chromebook Plus. It supports new, on-device Gemini AI features, including the ability to search the web for the contents of a screenshot and built-in image editing tools within Google Gallery. The 14-inch laptop features a 1920 x 1200 OLED screen and runs on an eight-core MediaTek Kompanio Ultra processor. It also supports Wi-Fi 7, can drive two external displays, and can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It has two 5GBps USB-C ports, one 5Gbps USB-A port, and a 3.5mm combo audio jack.\nThe base model starts at $649, while the touchscreen version starts at $749.99. Lenovo hasn’t provided availability details for the standard model yet, though the touchscreen version is available at Best Buy.\nMonica Chin and Nathan Edwards also contributed to previous versions of this buying guide.\nUpdate, July 3rd: Swapped the last-gen Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with the current-gen model and removed the “best laptop under $400” category.
