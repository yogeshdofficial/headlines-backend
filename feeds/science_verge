However, with Apple’s deep involvement in the Matter smart home standard, it’s possible that support for these devices might come to Apple Home. \nMatter recently added support for most major appliance types as well as energy-intensive devices like heat pumps and electric water heaters, all of which could now more easily be integrated into Apple Home via Matter. The standard also supports battery energy storage systems and solar power devices such as inverters, panels, and hybrid solar / battery systems. When you connect the dots, it seems that this could be a natural next step for Apple’s smart home ambitions.","summary":"Apple’s smart home didn’t get a single nod during the WWDC keynote, but it turns out there are some interesting developments coming to the Home app around energy management.&#160; In a video posted to the Apple developer site this week, the company outlined its new EnergyKit framework, which allows developers to integrate energy data from [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/?p=685733","isoDate":"2025-06-11T21:34:22.000Z"},{"title":"Google will reduce Pixel 6A battery capacity due to overheating issues","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/685738/google-pixel-6a-battery-overheating-update","pubDate":"2025-06-11T21:10:39.000Z","author":"Jay Peters","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/vpavic_220708_5335_0008.jpg.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, Google shipped a Pixel 4A update to some owners that lowered <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338566/google-pixel-4a-battery-stability-replacement-reduced-capacity\">battery life</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/627543/google-pixel-4a-battery-update-overheating-recall\">mitigate overheating risk</a>, and soon, it’s going to do the same for the Pixel 6A. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“A subset of Pixel 6A phones will require a mandatory software update to reduce the risk of potential battery overheating,” Google’s Alex Moriconi says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. “The update will enable battery management features that will reduce capacity and charging performance after the battery reaches 400 charge cycles.

We’ve still got love for the console, and its many millions of owners, so we’ll keep recommending the best controllers for the Switch right here.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you may already know that the best Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console. The removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient, given they can be detached for wireless use, but their tiny shape doesn’t do them many favors. They aren’t comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions — especially if you have large hands. And, you’re definitely not alone if you’ve experienced Joy-Con drift.</p>\n\n<p>In this buying guide, we’ll focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed that may match your unique play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock here, as they’re mostly similar to each other and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (<a href=\"https://www.powera.com/c/nintendo/nintendo-switch/controllers/\">PowerA</a> and <a href=\"https://pdp.com/collections/nintendo-switch-controllers\">PDP</a> make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it likely won’t support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to turn on the Switch remotely. However, there are exceptions, which we feature below.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official <a href=\"https://howl.link/lij43lpwkhtzg\">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>. It’s the only traditional gamepad that includes every feature mentioned above, and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers to use that we’ve tested. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joysticks-Compatible-macOS-Black-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0D3X6THN8\">GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joysticks-Compatible-macOS-Black-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0CQLNSGH4\">Max</a>, meanwhile, offer more exhaustive customization, while the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/HORI-Nintendo-Switch-Split-Pad-Pro-Ergonomic-Controller-for-Handheld-Mode-Officially-Licensed-By-Nintendo-Black/539959895\">Hori Split Pad Pro</a> is a Joy-Con upgrade for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL\">8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B0CSPGMGBT/\">DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller</a>, both of which are worth checking out.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we test Nintendo Switch controllers</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">We test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, racers like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and shooters like <em>Overwatch 2</em>. We pay attention to how everything feels — buttons, triggers, analog sticks, the D-pad — noting whether anything seems off.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Connectivity</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Does it support Bluetooth?

In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although it can’t wake the new console from sleep — you’ll need a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review\">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> for that).</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation.</p>\n\n<p>Given the high price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details\">Switch 2 Pro controller</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xKHdxh\">The best Switch controller for handheld mode</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch, Switch OLED / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Joy-Con slots / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> No / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> via Joy-Con slots / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p>I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.</p>\n\n<p>The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch&nbsp;console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23334097/cfaulkner_141231_5091_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Split Pad Pro fits in your Switch’s Joy-Con slots and doubles as a standalone controller with the optional attachment set.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC&nbsp;— so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23007610/hori-split-pad-pro-attachment-nintendo-switch-price-features-review\">Split Pad Pro Attachment</a> seen above that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).</p>\n\n<p>The company also sells the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348870/hori-split-pad-compact-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-features\">Split Pad Compact</a>, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that costs $50.

We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.</p>\n\n<p>But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JluAuIJ-tSY\">iFixit explains here</a>. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features\">Xbox Elite Series 2</a> and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/gulikit-kk3-pro.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723395278369,100,78.553209443262\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;GuliKit’s newest Switch controllers offer ample customization.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer <em>a lot</em> for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nwIiGD\">The best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, Switch 2 (with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/681153/8bitdo-controller-gamepad-nintendo-switch-2-compatible-firmware-update\">update</a>), PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL\">8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. </p>\n\n<p>It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the battery. Speaking of, it typically lasts around 22 hours, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.</p>\n\n<p>The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options for a couple of reasons. One because it’s the only version of the Ultimate that’s compatible with the Switch. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24827602/61ZrQruCQWL._SL1500_.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.772212081113,100,78.455575837775\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 8BitDo Ultimate is a terrific alternative to Nintendo’s official pro controller.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap.

It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up <a href=\"https://crkd.gg/collections/allndp\"><strong>Nitro Deck Plus</strong></a> adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lK3UFj\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Mag-ResTM-Lightning-Mac/dp/B0DK4NPYX6/\">GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</a></h3>\n\n<p>We recently tested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Mag-ResTM-Lightning-Mac/dp/B0DK4NPYX6/\"><strong>GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</strong></a> ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0D41BBD7P\">GuliKit KingKong 3 </a>— including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lru39S\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\">PowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller</a></h3>\n\n<p>We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\"><strong>GameCube Style Wireless Controller</strong></a> ($38.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Black/dp/B08DRRJBC6?th=1\">PowerA Enhanced Wireless</a> </strong>($41.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here\">Switch 2</a> is here. Nintendo’s new console is both bigger and more powerful than the original model. There are many new accessories at launch, including new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo\">Joy-Con 2 controllers</a>, plus a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details\">refreshed Switch Pro Controller</a> that features customizable rear paddles. There’s also a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/666302/gamecube-switch-2-nintendo-preorder-buy\">Switch 2-exclusive wireless GameCube controller</a> releasing that Switch Online subscribers have a chance to buy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Thankfully, Nintendo has <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68426/~/nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-accessory-compatibility\">published an in-depth support page</a> regarding the Switch 2’s compatibility (or lack of compatibility) for original (and official) Switch accessories. Good news: most of them will work just fine. They just won’t have the C button. However, compatibility with third-party products may be hit-and-miss. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/681153/8bitdo-controller-gamepad-nintendo-switch-2-compatible-firmware-update\">8BitDo</a> has released updates for some of its controllers, and other companies will likely follow suit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern, since most manufacturers are likely at work on Switch 2 controllers. 8BitDo has announced a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/648989/8bitdo-ultimate-2-bluetooth-controller-nintendo-switch?_gl=1*msccoq*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwqv2_BhC0ARIsAFb5Ac-c__RUHiTpkj7NYaUilo0dRXEsyhhRHqkR05sQQVbYeNO9ItUm4N0aAsh2EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9k5E7DxDC-acgjo1JjJa5osaZB2D\">Switch-compatible Ultimate 2 controller with anti-drifting TMR analog sticks</a> that costs $69.99. There’s nothing else notable on the immediate horizon, however, and that probably won’t change until the Switch 2 arrives in June.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, June 11th:</strong> Updated to reflect current pricing / availability. Also, we added that the 8BitDo Ultimate and Pro 2 are Switch 2-compatible with an update. Also, we noted that the Switch Pro Controller can’t wake the Switch 2 from sleep as it can with the original Switch.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, but we can’t just forget about the original Switch. We’ve still got love for the console, and its many millions of owners, so we’ll keep recommending the best controllers for the Switch right here.\nNow, you may already know that the best Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console. The removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient, given they can be detached for wireless use, but their tiny shape doesn’t do them many favors. They aren’t comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions — especially if you have large hands. And, you’re definitely not alone if you’ve experienced Joy-Con drift.\nIn this buying guide, we’ll focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed that may match your unique play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock here, as they’re mostly similar to each other and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (PowerA and PDP make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)\nAlso, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it likely won’t support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to turn on the Switch remotely. However, there are exceptions, which we feature below.\nIf you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. It’s the only traditional gamepad that includes every feature mentioned above, and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers to use that we’ve tested. The GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and Max, meanwhile, offer more exhaustive customization, while the Hori Split Pad Pro is a Joy-Con upgrade for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s 8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller and DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller, both of which are worth checking out.\nFeatured in this article\n\n\nHow we test Nintendo Switch controllers\nWe test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters like Overwatch 2. We pay attention to how everything feels — buttons, triggers, analog sticks, the D-pad — noting whether anything seems off.\n\n\n\n\n\nConnectivity\nDoes it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz? Ideally (but not always), a controller we recommend is compatible with other platforms, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality\nDo the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra features and customization\nAre there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macro settings? Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nIs it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nThe best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nEver since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although it can’t wake the new console from sleep — you’ll need a Switch 2 Pro Controller for that).\nAside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.\nThe buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation.\nGiven the high price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and its Switch 2 Pro controller.\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch OLED / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No\nI’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.\nThe Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.\nThe Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Pro Attachment seen above that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).\nThe company also sells the Split Pad Compact, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that costs $50. It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.\nRead our Hori Split Pad Pro review.\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nOn the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.\nBut there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).\nAdditionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge. \nThe longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.\nIn summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.\nThe best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2 (with update), PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\n8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. \nIt also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the battery. Speaking of, it typically lasts around 22 hours, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.\nThe Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options for a couple of reasons. One because it’s the only version of the Ultimate that’s compatible with the Switch. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.\nAs for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2 (with update) PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\nThe 8BitDo Pro 2 is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller layout. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. \nIt has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.\nWith 8BitDo’s Ultimate software on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. \nOn its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for around $40 (or slightly more if you want one of the incredibly cool translucent blue, purple, or green editions).\nRead our 8BitDo Pro 2 review.\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nThere are many other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch (or Switch 2) controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)\nTo our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app. \n8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.\nIf you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nNitro Deck / Nitro Deck Plus\nWe like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).\nGameSir T4 Cyclone Pro\nWe recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.\nPowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller\nWe also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($38.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($41.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.\nWhat’s coming next?\nThe Switch 2 is here. Nintendo’s new console is both bigger and more powerful than the original model. There are many new accessories at launch, including new Joy-Con 2 controllers, plus a refreshed Switch Pro Controller that features customizable rear paddles. There’s also a Switch 2-exclusive wireless GameCube controller releasing that Switch Online subscribers have a chance to buy.\nThat brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Thankfully, Nintendo has published an in-depth support page regarding the Switch 2’s compatibility (or lack of compatibility) for original (and official) Switch accessories. Good news: most of them will work just fine. They just won’t have the C button. However, compatibility with third-party products may be hit-and-miss. 8BitDo has released updates for some of its controllers, and other companies will likely follow suit.\nAs for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern, since most manufacturers are likely at work on Switch 2 controllers. 8BitDo has announced a Switch-compatible Ultimate 2 controller with anti-drifting TMR analog sticks that costs $69.99. There’s nothing else notable on the immediate horizon, however, and that probably won’t change until the Switch 2 arrives in June.\nUpdate, June 11th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability. Also, we added that the 8BitDo Ultimate and Pro 2 are Switch 2-compatible with an update. Also, we noted that the Switch Pro Controller can’t wake the Switch 2 from sleep as it can with the original Switch.","summary":"The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, but we can’t just forget about the original Switch.

While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>A robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that <em>excel</em> at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\">my guide to floor sweeping bots</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Combo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do, yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A multifunction charging dock</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">This is a charging base that empties the robot’s bin, washes and dries the bot’s mops, and empties and refills its water tank. This is essential if you want to be as hands-free as possible when mopping your floor. <br><br>Some offer hot water washing and drying options that will keep your pads cleaner for longer. But you’ll want to throw them in the wash eventually. A dock that can self-clean the washboard (the area where it cleans the mops) is a nice upgrade, as you won’t have to do it yourself as often.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Big tanks (or a plumbing hookup)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">The bigger the clean and dirty water tanks on the dock, the less often you’ll have to refill them. If the dock can connect directly to the plumbing, even better; it&#8217;s a more complicated install, but makes for a more hands-off experience long term.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Better mops</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Mop type matters. The main options are circular and spinning, flat and vibrating, or rolling and self-cleaning. Rolling (like the beater bar on a vacuum cleaner) is my favorite because it does a better job of getting floors really clean. The greater surface area of a roller mop, combined with the self-cleaning function — the vac sprays water onto the mop as it runs — makes it a more effective option than flat or spinning mops in most cases. However, oscillating mops that can extend outwards are better at getting into grout between tiles, along baseboards, and under low furniture.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Mops that lift or drop</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">If you have low-pile rugs and carpet, mop pads that the robot can lift up (by at least 10 mm) should prevent your carpets from getting damp when the robot rolls over them. However, robots that can remove the mop pads entirely before vacuuming carpets are a good option, especially if you have high-pile rugs.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Decent mop pressure and speed</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Specs around mop pressure and rotation speed are similar to those for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner#:~:text=Does%20suction%20power%20matter%20in%20robot%20vacuums%3F\">suction power on the vacuum</a>; they matter to some extent, but what’s more important is how effective the pads are. <br><br>The higher the pressure, the more effective it should be on tougher stains. The higher the rotations per minute (RPMs), the more friction the stain has to deal with. It&#8217;s hard to judge pressure, as several manufacturers don’t list it and those that do use different measurements, but 12 Newtons, roughly 2.2 pounds of downward pressure, is very good.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A usable app</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">A well-laid-out app is key. It should let you choose which rooms to clean, and in what order. Generally, you want a mopping bot to clean the dirtiest room last (think bathroom or hallway) to avoid cross-contamination. I also look for the option to mop only, in addition to mop <em>and</em> vacuum, or vacuum <em>then</em> mop, and, of course, vacuum only.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#best-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best robot vacuum and mop</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-budget-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best budget robot vacuum and mop</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-midrange-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best midrange robot vacuum and mop</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-for-a-mix-of-hard-floors-and-rugs\">Best robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-for-hardwood-floors\">Best robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-for-tile-floors\">Best robot vacuum and mop for tile floors</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-a-plumbing-hookup\">Best robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup</a></li><li><a href=\"#how-i-test-robot-vacuums\">How I test robot vacuums</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-i-m-currently-testing-and-what-s-coming-next\">What I’m currently testing and what’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock:</em></strong><em> Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / </em><strong><em>Mop style: </em></strong><em>Roller</em> <em>/ </em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes, hot water and hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop pressure:</em></strong><em> 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 10mm /&nbsp; </em><strong><em>Edge cleaning:</em></strong><em> Yes, mop extension / </em><strong><em>Mapping</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 18,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Single rubber/bristle / </em><strong><em>Works with:</em></strong><em> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter support promised</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ecovacs’ <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ECOVACS-DEEBOT-PRO-OMNI-Self-Emptying/dp/B0DR8NJMCJ\">Deebot X8 Pro Omni</a> is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ECOVACS-Self-Emptying-Auto-Refill-Obstacle-Avoidance/dp/B0CDPJ2C94\">Deebot X2 Omni</a>, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops).&nbsp;At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2991.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The roller mop can extend outwards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2977.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tank for cleaning solution is refillable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>This is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2975.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The water tanks are easily accessible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2960.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.173651910196,93.51484375,73.441109757773\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock is small with nice rose gold accents.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It&#8217;s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268508/hacked-ecovacs-deebot-x2-racial-slurs-chase-pets\">suffered a hack</a> last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it&#8217;s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn&#8217;t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can&#8217;t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best budget robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock:</em></strong><em> No &#8211; just auto empty / <strong><em>Mop style:</em></strong><em> Vibrating pad / </em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> No / </em></em><strong><em>Mop pressure:</em></strong><em> 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute&nbsp;/ </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 5mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning:</em></strong><em> No / </em><strong><em>Mapping</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 6,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Dual rubber / </em><strong><em>Works with:</em></strong><em> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won’t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won’t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won’t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 wasn’t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock’s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that’s with its auto-empty dock.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9220.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 Plus adds an auto-empty dock to the robot vacuum&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9244.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 has a camera for navigation and obstacle detection.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9234.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It features an onboard water tank that you have to manually refill.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9230.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a flat mopping pad that vibrates to simulate scrubbing, excellent dual rubber roller brushes.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9235.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock has a dustbin but no water tanks.

It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn’t have any edge cleaning options, so it won’t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another great feature at this price is carpet sensing — the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you’re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-more-of-my-roborock-s8-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23846479/best-budget-robot-vacuum-robot-mop#:~:text=Best%20budget%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop\">Read more of my Roborock S8 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-midrange-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best midrange robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock:</em></strong><em> Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / <strong><em>Mop style:</em></strong><em> Dual spinning pads / </em></em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes, hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM&nbsp;/ </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 12 mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning:</em></strong><em> Yes, swinging motion / </em><strong><em>Mapping</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 8,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Single rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with:</em></strong><em> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1065.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy is a large robot with a square-shaped front.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1070.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Its dual spinning mop pads are paired with a single rubber/bristle roller brush.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1073.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a removable washboard for easier cleaning.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1074.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The water tanks are easy to remove for refilling.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables.

It’s not quite as <span>effective as a mop&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, e</span>liminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Along with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1427.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The X40 Ultra has self-removable, dual spinning mopping pads.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1430.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Its washboard is also removable and has rotating wipers that clean out the area.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1420.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729498539469,100,78.541002921062\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The multifunction dock is tall but slimline and with a nice look&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas.

With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1434_8968b5.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy S1 has a unique “love it or hate it” look. I kind of love it.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3123.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy’s 11.4-inch roller brush extends almost the entire length of the front.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/IMG_3457.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.361925152446,100,39.276149695107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy has two spinning side brushes, which help get dirt into the bot’s path. &lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-for-tile-floors\">Best robot vacuum and mop for tile floors</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / <strong>Mop style: </strong>Dual triangular spinning pads / </em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes, hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop Pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 12mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, robot swing and fluffer / </em><strong><em>Mapping:</em></strong><em> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 12,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Narwal&#8217;s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner#best-robot-vacuum-mop-hybrid:~:text=empty%20its%20bin.-,Best%20mopping%20robot%20vacuum%20for%20hard%20floors,-8\">Freo X Ultra</a>, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3083.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A fluffy sidebrush and swinging motion help the bot clean along edges and baseboards.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3082.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Triangular-shaped mopping pads meet in the middle, meaning fewer missed spots.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that&#8217;s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237324/this-robot-vacuum-has-two-eyes-to-see-your-floors-better\">dual camera system</a> allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it&#8217;s clean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3092.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A control panel on the top provides quick access to control the robot.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3093.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock contains a dustbin, two water tanks, and a non-refillable proprietary cleaning solution.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a <em>lot</em> of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, its app can be frustrating. It&#8217;s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-a-plumbing-hookup\">Best robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / <strong>Mop style: </strong>Roller</em><strong> / <em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes (during use), hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop Pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 7mm /&nbsp; </em><strong><em>Edge cleaning</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> No / </em><strong><em>Mapping:</em></strong><em> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 6,500Pa / <strong>Vacuum b</strong></em><strong><em>rush style:</em></strong><em> Single rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23845579/switchbot-s10-robot-vacuum-mop-launch-ifa\">The SwitchBot S10</a> is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1219.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S10 is a very large and heavy robot.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1225.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a single rubber roller brush and a roller mop&lt;/em&gt;.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1252.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The roller mop is longer than the Deebot X8 but not as long as the Eufy S1.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1246.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It comes with two stations: a battery-powered water station that you hook to your plumbing …&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1239.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;… and an auto-empty station that requires power and also dries the mop.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best.

It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-full-switchbot-s10-review\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">Read my full SwitchBot S10 review</a>.</strong></h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"how-i-test-robot-vacuums\">How I test robot vacuums</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">I’ve been testing robot vacuums for 6 years and have tested over 60 models.

While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.\nThe difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\n\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier \n\n\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor sweeping bots. \nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week. \nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board. \nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do, yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier. \nFeatured in this article\n\n\nA multifunction charging dock\nThis is a charging base that empties the robot’s bin, washes and dries the bot’s mops, and empties and refills its water tank. This is essential if you want to be as hands-free as possible when mopping your floor. \nSome offer hot water washing and drying options that will keep your pads cleaner for longer. But you’ll want to throw them in the wash eventually. A dock that can self-clean the washboard (the area where it cleans the mops) is a nice upgrade, as you won’t have to do it yourself as often.\n\n\n\n\n\nBig tanks (or a plumbing hookup)\nThe bigger the clean and dirty water tanks on the dock, the less often you’ll have to refill them. If the dock can connect directly to the plumbing, even better; it’s a more complicated install, but makes for a more hands-off experience long term.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter mops\nMop type matters. The main options are circular and spinning, flat and vibrating, or rolling and self-cleaning. Rolling (like the beater bar on a vacuum cleaner) is my favorite because it does a better job of getting floors really clean. The greater surface area of a roller mop, combined with the self-cleaning function — the vac sprays water onto the mop as it runs — makes it a more effective option than flat or spinning mops in most cases. However, oscillating mops that can extend outwards are better at getting into grout between tiles, along baseboards, and under low furniture. \n\n\n\n\n\nMops that lift or drop\nIf you have low-pile rugs and carpet, mop pads that the robot can lift up (by at least 10 mm) should prevent your carpets from getting damp when the robot rolls over them. However, robots that can remove the mop pads entirely before vacuuming carpets are a good option, especially if you have high-pile rugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecent mop pressure and speed\nSpecs around mop pressure and rotation speed are similar to those for suction power on the vacuum; they matter to some extent, but what’s more important is how effective the pads are. \nThe higher the pressure, the more effective it should be on tougher stains. The higher the rotations per minute (RPMs), the more friction the stain has to deal with. It’s hard to judge pressure, as several manufacturers don’t list it and those that do use different measurements, but 12 Newtons, roughly 2.2 pounds of downward pressure, is very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nA usable app\nA well-laid-out app is key. It should let you choose which rooms to clean, and in what order. Generally, you want a mopping bot to clean the dirtiest room last (think bathroom or hallway) to avoid cross-contamination. I also look for the option to mop only, in addition to mop and vacuum, or vacuum then mop, and, of course, vacuum only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nHow I test robot vacuums\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /  Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter support promised\nEcovacs’ Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop. \nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops). At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\n\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested\n\n\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It’s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it’s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\n\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\n\n\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn’t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can’t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else. \nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: No – just auto empty / Mop style: Vibrating pad / Mop washing: No / Mop pressure: 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute / Mop lift: Yes, 5mm / Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won’t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors. \nUnlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won’t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won’t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.\nThe S8 wasn’t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock’s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that’s with its auto-empty dock.\nOne of my favorite features of the S8 is that it can be set to mop only, and it does an excellent job, moving in a tighter “Z” pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn’t have any edge cleaning options, so it won’t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.\nAnother great feature at this price is carpet sensing — the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.\nThe S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you’re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.\nRead more of my Roborock S8 review.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range. \nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. \nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown  / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It’s not quite as effective as a mop or vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn’t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I’m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /  Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless. \nI found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables. \nThe S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove. \n\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\n\n\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them. \nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer. \nThe S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines. \nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal’s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\n\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\n\n\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that’s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it’s clean. \n\n\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.  \nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It’s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all. \nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /  Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot’s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\n\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats — which are the bane of most mopping bots\n\n\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn’t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently announced the SwitchBot S20 Pro, slated to launch this summer. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nHow I test robot vacuums\nI’ve been testing robot vacuums for 6 years and have tested over 60 models. I write The Verge’s Best robot vacuum buying guide and the Best budget robot vacuum guide, and for this guide, I tested 15 different mopping robots.\nTo evaluate the bots, I ran each regularly for at least a week and measured their progress, evaluating how clean the floor stays, how well they navigate, how often I had to refill the tanks, how well the auto-empty function worked, and how easy the app was to use.\nI run them in my kitchen, where I have hardwood floors, and in a large bathroom with a white tile floor — one that looks filthy just a day after being cleaned. For specific tests, I deploy a wet and dry challenge. The wet challenge features dried-on OJ and ketchup, plus fresh spills of milk, water, and some kind of sauce. For the dry challenge, I place cereal (usually Cheerios) and oatmeal (a really tough one to clean). I evaluate how well the bots deal with mopping the stains and vacuuming the debris.\nFinally, I test their obstacle detection by running them through an obstacle course featuring common robot trip-ups, including fake dog poop, cables, socks, and tricky chair legs.\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\nAs mentioned before, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($1,599.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven’t put it through its paces yet.\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($2,599), the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up light objects — including socks, tissues, and sandals. The arm isn’t the most reliable, and the vac occasionally struggles with correctly identifying items, but it’s otherwise an excellent robot vacuum with 22,000Pa of suction power and dual spinning mop pads it can remove on its own. Read our review.\nRoborock’s cheaper Qrevo Curv ($1,099.99 $1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company’s Qrevo Slim ($1,099.99 $1,399.99) offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock ($799.99 $999) also offers heated mop drying, a feature the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max lacks.\nPriced at $999.99, Eufy’s new Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum with a rolling mop that can go over tough stains a second time if needed. The charging dock also includes a built-in deep cleaner that sprays water to tackle stains before sucking the mess into a separate wastewater tank.\nThe Narwal Flow sports the brand’s first roller mop, which can also extend. It claims to be able to tackle thick, fluffy carpets with a deep carpet boost mode and is scheduled to arrive sometime in June.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry. Here’s some video of it in action.\nEureka’s J20 ($899.99 $1,099.99 ) features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction. The forthcoming J15 Max Ultra ($1,299) can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It’s an upgrade to the J15 Pro Ultra ($799.99 $999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,299.99 $1,699.99) features a “motorized swing arm” that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe Switchbot S20 Pro is the successor to the S10 and is scheduled to launch this summer. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, more than twice that of the S10.\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum mop ($769.99 $999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions. Its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags.\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, June 11th: Added details about the Saros Z70 and adjusted pricing / availability.
