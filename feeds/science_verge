Most of us probably won’t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we’ll even have models that can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24338956/dreame-robot-vacuum-legs-arm-tools\">pick up dirty laundry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24333438/switchbot-multitasking-household-robot-k20-plus-pro-price-specs-release-date\">purify the air</a> in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#best-roborock-deals\">The best Roborock deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#KkTLAn\">The best Dreame deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-switchbot-deals\">The best SwitchBot deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-eufy-deals\">The best Eufy deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#KkTLAn\">The best Yeedi deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-shark-deals\">The best Shark deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-roomba-deals\">The best Roomba deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-dyson-deals\">The best Dyson deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#other-robot-vacuum-deals\">Other robot vacuum deals</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of <em>Verge</em>-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-roborock-deals\">The best Roborock deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Roborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra</strong> — our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — is available from <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-flexiarm-design-side-brush-10000-pa-suction-and-8-in-1-rockdock-ultra-white/6579466.p\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra/\">Roborock</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQLQVTDH/\">Amazon</a> for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. It’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KkTLAn\">The best Dreame deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Dreame X40 Ultra</strong> is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $899.99 ($600 off)<strong> </strong>directly from <a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/dreametech-x40-ultra-robot-vacuum\">Dreame</a>, which matches its all-time low. You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.</p>\n\n<p>The Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Dreame L20 Ultra</strong> is available for<strong> </strong>$599.99 ($400 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT\">Amazon</a> (for Prime members) and <a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/l20-ultra\">Dreame</a>, which is $50 shy of its best price to date.<strong> </strong>The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-switchbot-deals\">The best SwitchBot deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>SwitchBot S10</strong> is available from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSNB6TF8\">Amazon</a> for an all-time low price of $390.99 at checkout, down from $1,199. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.</p>\n\n<p>The S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125273/switchbot-robot-vacuum-matter-support\">robovacs with Matter support</a>, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5ticpp\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">Read our SwitchBot S10 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>SwitchBot K10 Plus</strong> is available for around $240 ($260 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Self-Empty-Navigation-Compatible-Connected/dp/B0CHBC7BW1\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-mini-robot-vacuum-k10/\">SwitchBot</a> (with promo code <strong>FGFG50</strong>), which is an all-time low<strong>. </strong>At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-eufy-deals\">The best Eufy deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</strong>, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eufy-x10-pro-omni-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-self-washing-and-self-drying-auto-empty-station-black/6576392.p\">Best Buy</a> for $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of its all-time low.

It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight.

The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It’s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KkTLAn\">The best Yeedi deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Yeedi Cube</strong> is currently down to an all-time low of $246.99 ($243 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-Washing-Emptying-Obstacle-Climbing/dp/B0CDX5QL9T\">Amazon</a> for Prime members. It’s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.</p>\n\n<p>With 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair. It mops better than most models in its range, however, namely because its vibrating microfiber pads can actually scrub your floors. The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-shark-deals\">The best Shark deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The<strong> Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1</strong> is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s now on sale for $399.99 ($320 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Mopping-CleanEdge-Technology-RV2610WA/dp/B0B8B6N2G4\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/shark-matrix-plus-2-in-1-robot-vacuum-mop-with-sonic-mopping-matrix-clean-home-mapping-hepa-bagless-self-empty-wifi-black/6514530.p\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sharkclean.com/products/shark-matrix-plus-2-in-1-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-xl-hepa-self-empty-base-zidRV2610WA\">directly from Shark</a>, which is $20 shy of its all-time low price.

Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Shark Ion</strong> is a a solid bump-and-roll bot that’s currently on sale for $179.99 ($70 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shark-AV753-Connected-Runtime-Cleaning/dp/B08C6XGP4F/\">Amazon</a>, which is one of its better prices to date. It does a good job of picking up dirt and debris, and with a 120-minute runtime, it won’t run out of juice as quickly as other models in its price range. Its hybrid roller brush, which combines bristle and plastic, also helps reduce unwanted tangling, which happens more frequently with standard bristle brushes. While the Ion doesn’t come with advanced features like mapping, it’s another good option if you’re looking for a no-frills robovac that’ll get the job done on a shoestring budget.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-roomba-deals\">The best Roomba deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can get<strong> iRobot’s Roomba Combo 10 Max</strong> from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D9ZRH61T/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/irobot-roomba-combo-10-max-robot-vacuum-and-mop-autowash-dock-x085020-black/6590394.p?\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba-combo-10-max-robot-with-autowash-dock/X085020.html\">iRobot</a> for $799.99 ($600 off), which is its second-best price to date. We think it’s the best robot vacuum for pet hair, one that combines high suction power with rotating dual rubber brushes that pick up without getting tangled. What’s even more impressive is that it comes with a new multifunction charging dock that allows it to empty its bin, wash its own mop, and even refill its mopping tank. Add in Matter support, excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, and a retractable mop arm, and you’ve got a robovac that makes cleaning almost entirely hands-free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re working with a tight budget, the <strong>Combo i5 </strong>is also a good vacuum / mop — one you can pick up on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C415KNH8/\">Amazon</a> right now for $199.99, down from $349.99. It’s not as powerful as the aforementioned Combo 10 Max and can’t refill its water tank or wash and dry its own mop; however, it still features Roomba’s wide, dual rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of picking up dirt and debris. It doesn’t support virtual keep-out zones or Matter, either, though you can schedule it to clean specific rooms at set times. It’s also compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and like all Roombas, it’s relatively easy to repair.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-dyson-deals\">The best Dyson deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The&nbsp;<strong>Dyson 360 Vis Nav</strong> is now available from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dyson-360-Vis-Robot-Vacuum/dp/B0CT95LTCJ/\">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/dyson-360-vis-nav-robot-vacuum-blue-nickel/6577400.p\">Best Buy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dyson.com/vacuum-cleaners/robot/360-vis-nav/blue-nickel\">Dyson</a>&nbsp;for around $799.95 ($200 off), which is its best price yet.

Most of us probably won’t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.\nToday’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we’ll even have models that can pick up dirty laundry and purify the air in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Roborock deals\nThe best Dreame deals\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nThe best Eufy deals\nThe best Yeedi deals\nThe best Shark deals\nThe best Roomba deals\nThe best Dyson deals\nOther robot vacuum deals\n\nBut if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of Verge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.\nThe best Roborock deals\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra — our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — is available from Best Buy, Roborock, and Amazon for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. It’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.\nThe best Dreame deals\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $899.99 ($600 off) directly from Dreame, which matches its all-time low. You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.\nThe Dreame L20 Ultra is available for $599.99 ($400 off) from Amazon (for Prime members) and Dreame, which is $50 shy of its best price to date. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.\nThe L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nThe SwitchBot S10 is available from Amazon for an all-time low price of $390.99 at checkout, down from $1,199. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.\nThe S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few robovacs with Matter support, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).\nRead our SwitchBot S10 review.\nThe SwitchBot K10 Plus is available for around $240 ($260 off) from Amazon and SwitchBot (with promo code FGFG50), which is an all-time low. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.\nThe best Eufy deals\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available at Amazon and Best Buy for $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of its all-time low. You can also grab it directly from Eufy for the same price when you use promo code WS24T2351121 at checkout.\nThe X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.\nMind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock too frequently.\nIf you’re looking for a bump-and-roll model that’s relatively budget-friendly, the discontinued Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon for just $179.99 ($70 off). The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone. Instead, you can control it using an on-board button or with the included remote, which also allows you to create cleaning schedules. It’s relatively quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.\nThe best Yeedi deals\nThe Yeedi Cube is currently down to an all-time low of $246.99 ($243 off) at Amazon for Prime members.

Before the Eufy X10 Pro Omni took its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.\nThe Shark Ion is a a solid bump-and-roll bot that’s currently on sale for $179.99 ($70 off) at Amazon, which is one of its better prices to date.

It’s also compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and like all Roombas, it’s relatively easy to repair.\nThe best Dyson deals\nThe Dyson 360 Vis Nav is now available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Dyson for around $799.95 ($200 off), which is its best price yet. The D-shaped robot vacuum is the best option for carpets we’ve ever tested, one that can deliver an impressive 65 air watts of suction.

Similar to Apple’s Find My app, it allows authorized members of a “Circle” to see each other’s real-time locations in the app. Each member has control over whether the app shares their location, as well as how precise a view of their location other members have at any time. The service can send alerts to members of your circle when you arrive somewhere, leave somewhere, and when your flight lands. It essentially does away with all those “text me when you get there” requests from parents and family members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Life360 offers more than just location services. It styles itself as an overall family safety app and has features such as crash detection and roadside assistance.
