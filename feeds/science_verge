These deals could end at any time, and we wouldn’t expect them to last very long. Still, if you sat out Prime Day this year, there’s still a chance to get that big-screen TV, a robot vacuum, or a pair of wireless earbuds at a steep discount.\n\nSmart home deals\nVacuum deals\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nCharger and cable deals\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nSmartphone deals\nMovies and TV show deals\nDesktop and laptop deals\nTablet and e-reader deals\nTV and streaming deals\nSoundbar and Bluetooth speaker deals\nVideo game deals\nGaming accessory deals\nPC add-on deals\nBoard game deals\nLego deals\nVerge favorites and other miscellaneous deals\n\nSmart home deals\nSwitchBot Smart Switch Button Pusher\nIf you’ve ever wished you had a robot that could push a button for you, that’s precisely what the SwitchBot Bot does. It’s simple, smart, and works on anything with a button. Stick it on the device you want to turn on or off, and you’re set. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $20.99 at SwitchBot (with code SWPD33)\n\nThe entry-level Google Nest Thermostat is a pared-down version of the fourth-gen model, one that features a monochrome screen but lacks the ability to learn your heating / cooling routines. Still, it’s a solid smart thermostat that’s currently on sale for $83.49 (nearly $47 off) at Amazon, which is its lowest price of the year. Read our review.\nGoogle’s fourth-gen Nest Learning Thermostat is one of the best we’ve tested, and it’s marked down to $219.99 ($60 off) at Amazon. It comes with a temperature sensor you can place in a room that you want to monitor, and it’ll use that reading to decide whether to turn your system on or off. The thermostat learns your HVAC usage patterns over time, so it can automatically heat and cool your home based on your typical schedule. Read our review.\nThe battery-powered Google Nest Doorbell is down to $119 ($60 off) at Amazon, matching its lowest price to date, in the color of your choice. There are certain omissions you’ll encounter with the battery model versus the pricier option. For example, it lacks 4K video and 24/7 capture. If those don’t bother you, this is a solid option, especially in the design department.

The budget robot vacuum features built-in mops, and its cleaning station can store debris from the vacuum, as well as wash and dry the mop components to prevent them from smelling after doing some dirty work.\nIf you don’t need a robot vacuum that can sweep your baseboards or empty its own bin, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $139.99 ($140 off), which is one of its better prices to date. The entry-level robovac isn’t the smartest option available, but it’s at least aware enough not to bump into walls or tumble over stairs. The 11S Max offers good carpet and hard surface cleaning with relative quietness, too, and its 600ml bin is roomy enough to go through several cleanings before it needs to be dumped.\nRobot vacuums are overrated. Black & Decker’s rechargeable Furbuster — now on sale at Amazon and Chewy for $79.99, its lowest price of the year — is a great handheld alternative that’s well-suited for picking up fur, dirt, and other unwanted debris, especially when you tack on the extra-long crevice tool or the included motorized pet brush.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nThe X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $499.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n\n\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nOur favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation.
