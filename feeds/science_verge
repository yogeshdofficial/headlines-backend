While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>A robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Newer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that <em>excel</em> at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\">my guide to floor sweeping bots</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Combo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do, yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Best overall: Deebot X8 Pro Omni</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Deebot X8 Pro Omni is an excellent roller mopping bot that extends to clean along backboards and furniture.

Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ECOVACS-Self-Emptying-Auto-Refill-Obstacle-Avoidance/dp/B0CDPJ2C94\">Deebot X2 Omni</a>, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops).&nbsp;At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2991.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The roller mop can extend outwards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2977.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tank for cleaning solution is refillable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>This is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2975.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,27.777777777778,100,44.444444444444\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The water tanks are easily accessible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A2960.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.2862859162227,9.0575633994281,90.942271917555,90.942436600572\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock is small with nice rose gold accents.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It&#8217;s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/12/24268508/hacked-ecovacs-deebot-x2-racial-slurs-chase-pets\">suffered a hack</a> last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it&#8217;s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>It easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn&#8217;t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can&#8217;t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Overall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best budget robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Roborock S8 Plus</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24762652/8A0A9237.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Sonic-mopping</li><li>Auto-mop lift</li><li>AI-powered obstacle avoidance</li><li>Dual-rubber roller brushes</li><li>Carpet detection</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Very large and wide</li><li>Have to wash the mop manually</li><li>Have to refill the water tank manually</li><li>No heated drying</li><li>Limited mop lift</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-S8-DuoRoller-ReactiveAI-Avoidance/dp/B0BVB1TRBN/\"> <strike>$399.99</strike> $349.99 at <strong>Amazon (with Prime)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-S8-Robot-Vacuum/dp/B0BR5CGYKY\"> <strike>$999.99</strike> $499.99 at <strong>Amazon (with auto-empty dock)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock:</em></strong><em> No &#8211; just auto empty / <strong><em>Mop style:</em></strong><em> Vibrating pad / </em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> No / </em></em><strong><em>Mop pressure:</em></strong><em> 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute&nbsp;/ </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 5mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning:</em></strong><em> No / </em><strong><em>Mapping</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 6,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Dual rubber / </em><strong><em>Works with:</em></strong><em> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won’t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won’t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won’t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 wasn’t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock’s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that’s with its auto-empty dock.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9220.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 Plus adds an auto-empty dock to the robot vacuum&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9244.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 has a camera for navigation and obstacle detection.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9234.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It features an onboard water tank that you have to manually refill.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9230.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a flat mopping pad that vibrates to simulate scrubbing, excellent dual rubber roller brushes.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A9235.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock has a dustbin but no water tanks.

It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn’t have any edge cleaning options, so it won’t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another great feature at this price is carpet sensing — the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you’re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-more-of-my-roborock-s8-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23846479/best-budget-robot-vacuum-robot-mop#:~:text=Best%20budget%20robot%20vacuum%20and%20mop\">Read more of my Roborock S8 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-midrange-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best midrange robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25349902/8A0A1063.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Good AI-powered obstacle detection</li><li>Effective mopping</li><li>Excellent value</li><li>Nice dock</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Single rubber / bristle brush</li><li>Lower suction power </li><li>No heated mop washing</li><li>Some navigation issues</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/eufy-Cordless-Robot-Vacuum-Cleaner-Obstacle-Avoidance/5440009519\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eufy-x10-pro-omni-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-self-washing-and-self-drying-auto-empty-station-black/6576392.p\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock:</em></strong><em> Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / <strong><em>Mop style:</em></strong><em> Dual spinning pads / </em></em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes, hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM&nbsp;/ </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 12 mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning:</em></strong><em> Yes, swinging motion / </em><strong><em>Mapping</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 8,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Single rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with:</em></strong><em> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1065.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy is a large robot with a square-shaped front.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1070.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Its dual spinning mop pads are paired with a single rubber/bristle roller brush.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1073.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a removable washboard for easier cleaning.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1074.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The water tanks are easy to remove for refilling.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do.

It’s not quite as <span>effective as a mop&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, e</span>liminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Along with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1427.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The X40 Ultra has self-removable, dual spinning mopping pads.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1430.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Its washboard is also removable and has rotating wipers that clean out the area.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1420.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.0044381324338758,0,99.991123735132,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The multifunction dock is tall but slimline and with a nice look&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas.

With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1434_8968b5.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy S1 has a unique “love it or hate it” look. I kind of love it.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>If you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3123.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy’s 11.4-inch roller brush extends almost the entire length of the front.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/IMG_3457.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.994184694115,100,50.01163061177\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy has two spinning side brushes, which help get dirt into the bot’s path. &lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-for-tile-floors\">Best robot vacuum and mop for tile floors</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Narwal Freo Z Ultra</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3091.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Superb mopping</li><li>Great obstacle avoidance</li><li>Excellent dirt detection</li><li>Self-cleans its washboard</li><li>Very quiet</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Minimal mop lift</li><li>Edge cleaning just okay</li><li>Uses a lot of water</li><li>App is unreliable</li><li></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.costco.com/narwal-freo-z-ultra-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-accessory-pack-bundle.product.4000317132.html\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $949.99 at <strong>Costco (with Accessory Pack Bundle)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NARWAL-Avoidance-Real-Time-Decisions-Hot-Water/dp/B0D7HG8H24/\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $949.99 at <strong>Amazon (with on-page coupon)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://us.narwal.com/products/narwal-freo-z-ultra-robot-vacuum-mop\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $949.99 at <strong>Narwal (with code FRZU)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / <strong>Mop style: </strong>Dual triangular spinning pads / </em><strong><em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes, hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop Pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 12mm /&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Edge cleaning</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, robot swing and fluffer / </em><strong><em>Mapping:</em></strong><em> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 12,000Pa / </em><strong><em>Vacuum brush style:</em></strong><em> Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Narwal&#8217;s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner#best-robot-vacuum-mop-hybrid:~:text=empty%20its%20bin.-,Best%20mopping%20robot%20vacuum%20for%20hard%20floors,-8\">Freo X Ultra</a>, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3083.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A fluffy sidebrush and swinging motion help the bot clean along edges and baseboards.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3082.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Triangular-shaped mopping pads meet in the middle, meaning fewer missed spots.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Vacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that&#8217;s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237324/this-robot-vacuum-has-two-eyes-to-see-your-floors-better\">dual camera system</a> allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it&#8217;s clean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-5 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3092.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;A control panel on the top provides quick access to control the robot.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A3093.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dock contains a dustbin, two water tanks, and a non-refillable proprietary cleaning solution.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a <em>lot</em> of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, its app can be frustrating. It&#8217;s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-a-plumbing-hookup\">Best robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>SwitchBot S10</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10260/8A0A1240.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Almost hands-free</li><li>Excellent roller mop</li><li>Self-cleans</li><li>Battery-powered water station</li><li>Supports Matter</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Big and wide</li><li>Can’t mop a second floor; it will only vacuum</li><li>Short battery life</li><li>Low suction power</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-floor-cleaning-robot-s10\"> <strike>$1199.99</strike> $499.99 at <strong>Switchbot (with code ROMT700)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Multifunction Dock</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / <strong>Mop style: </strong>Roller</em><strong> / <em>Mop washing:</em></strong><em> Yes (during use), hot air drying / </em><strong><em>Mop Pressure:</em></strong><em> 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / </em><strong><em>Mop lift:</em></strong><em> Yes, 7mm /&nbsp; </em><strong><em>Edge cleaning</em></strong><em><strong>:</strong> No / </em><strong><em>Mapping:</em></strong><em> Yes, lidar / </em><strong><em>AI-powered obstacle detection:</em></strong><em> Yes / </em><strong><em>Suction power:</em></strong><em> 6,500Pa / <strong>Vacuum b</strong></em><strong><em>rush style:</em></strong><em> Single rubber bristle hybrid / </em><strong><em>Works with: </em></strong><em>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23845579/switchbot-s10-robot-vacuum-mop-launch-ifa\">The SwitchBot S10</a> is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1219.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S10 is a very large and heavy robot.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1225.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It has a single rubber roller brush and a roller mop&lt;/em&gt;.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1252.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The roller mop is longer than the Deebot X8 but not as long as the Eufy S1.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1246.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,27.777777777778,100,44.444444444444\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It comes with two stations: a battery-powered water station that you hook to your plumbing …&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/8A0A1239.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;… and an auto-empty station that requires power and also dries the mop.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best.

The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">SwitchBot recently announced the SwitchBot S20 Pro, slated to launch this summer. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-full-switchbot-s10-review\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">Read my full SwitchBot S10 review</a>.</strong></h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"how-i-test-robot-vacuums\">What I’m currently testing and what’s coming next</h2>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/IMG_1975.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Narwal’s upcoming Narwal Flow features a big and wide extendable roller mop.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>As mentioned before, Ecovacs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665607/the-latest-ecovacs-vacuum-sounds-like-a-blast\">recently released a successor</a> to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($<a href=\"https://www.ecovacs.com/us/deebot-robotic-vacuum-cleaner/deebot-x9-pro-omni\">1,299.99</a>).

While they are still not as effective as good ol’ manual labor, if you run them regularly, they will help keep your floors cleaner with much less effort on your part.\nThe difference is that newer “combo” robot vacuum and mop models are designed to actually scrub your floors. The first robot vacuums that could also “mop” simply slapped a thin, flat microfiber pad on the bot that kind of Swiffer-ed your floor. Basically, all this was good for was getting up fine dirt that the vacuum left behind.\n\nA robot vacuum with a real mopping system will make your life easier \n\n\nNewer models now come with vibrating or oscillating mop pads, and some even have roller mops. Most models have onboard water tanks to keep the mops wet while in use, and many can wash and dry their mops in their charging docks, which also automatically empty and refill their water tanks, meaning less work for you.\nWhile most robot vacuums today come with some sort of mopping feature, this guide focuses on those that excel at mopping. If you’re more interested in the best vacuum, check out my guide to floor sweeping bots. \nThe downside to these combo bots with serious mopping chops is that they tend to be bigger and heavier and need more frequent intervention than regular vacuum bots. Water equals gunk, and cleaning their giant multifunction docks, even the self-cleaning ones, can be an icky job. You also have to empty and refill their tanks about once a week. \nMopping bots also need to return to their docks more frequently than robot vacuums in order to refill their onboard water tanks. This means they’ll take longer to clean your floors than a dedicated vacuuming model, but they are doing two jobs at once. Robot mops with roller mops will self-clean as they work, negating this issue, but these models are also the largest and bulkiest, as they carry a bigger water tank on board. \nCombo bots can mop and vacuum simultaneously, but for especially dirty floors, it’s best to have the option to vacuum first and then mop. A mop-only mode is also good, as you can send the bot to clean up a wet spill without it sucking up water — something they’re not designed to do, yet.\nIf you have a lot of hardwood or tile floors and constantly struggle with muddy paw prints or the general dirtiness of life with multiple pets, people, and kids, a good robot vacuum and mop combo will definitely make your life easier. \nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Deebot X8 Pro Omni\nThe Deebot X8 Pro Omni is an excellent roller mopping bot that extends to clean along backboards and furniture. It’s also a powerful vacuum with great obstacle avoidance, a small dock, and a convenient self-cleaning brush system.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 $969.99 at Amazon\n $1399.99 $1099.99 at Best Buy\n\nBest on a budget: Roborock S8 Plus\nRoborock’s S8 robot vacuum / mop offers a host of high-end features at an affordable price, including 6,000Pa of suction,  AI-powered obstacle detection, and dual rubber roller brushes that perform well on carpet.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $749.99 $349.99 at Amazon\n $999.99 $499.99 at Amazon (with auto-empty dock)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\n\nBest robot vacuum and mop\nDeebot X8 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-cleaning roller mop\nExtendable mop\nExcellent obstacle avoidance\nSmaller dock\n\nLimited mop lift\nHeavy, struggles with transitions\nSingle roller brush\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 $969.99 at Amazon\n $1399.99 $1099.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 4,000Pa at 200 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 10mm /  Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 18,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber/bristle / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Matter support promised\nEcovacs’ Deebot X8 Pro Omni is a welcome return to form for Ecovacs’ flagship line. Its new tower-less lidar navigation system did a much better job of mapping and navigating than the previous flagship, the Deebot X2 Omni, which was constantly getting lost in my tests. However, the most notable thing about the X8 is the Ozmo Roller Mop. \nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested, thanks mostly to the Ozmo’s ability to extend outwards to clean along baseboards and furniture. This is a unique feature on a roller mop (for now) that makes up for the mop’s relatively short length (both the Eufy S1 and Switchbot S10 have longer roller mops). At $1,299, the X8 is also one of the less expensive flagship models (though the new X9 Pro Omni retails for $1599.99).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 did an excellent job on my milk, OJ, and dried ketchup tests, absorbing the small spills with one or two passes. It covered the floors evenly, without leaving any streaks or gaps, something that I’ve seen happen with spinning mop pads. When it comes across an edge — be it a baseboard, furniture like a chair or table leg, or any obstacle — it extends out its mop to the right to clean as close as possible. It did an excellent job getting the grime up from the stools around my kitchen counter, something most other bots struggle to do.\n\nThis is the best roller mopping bot I’ve tested\n\n\nThe self-cleaning brush system kept the bot from smearing any spills it encountered. As it’s cleaning, a scraper squeegees off the dirty water and 16 nozzles spray it with fresh water and solution, if you use it. As with most high-end mopping bots, the dock has the option of auto-dispensing cleaning solution.\nThe X8 was the best vacuuming robot among the serious combo bots I tested, outperforming my Cheerio and oatmeal tests and doing a good job on rugs (when it could reach them). However, its vacuum has a relatively small, single rubber roller brush, which is less effective than Roborock’s and Roomba’s dual roller brush models (which include the S8 MaxV Ultra and the 10 Max).\n\n\n\n\nThe X8 uses lidar and a 3D camera for mapping; the latter also facilitates its obstacle detection, which is very good — it easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios. It’s much better at navigating than the X2, but it did occasionally get itself trapped, including when it went under a chair that was too low for it to get out from. The top of the robot was fairly scratched up after just one week of use. (Worth noting, Ecovacs suffered a hack last year in which bad actors could access the camera and microphone on the X2)\nThe X8’s multifunction dock is much smaller than the X2’s and has some nice rose gold accents. Its water tanks are integrated into the dock and supereasy to remove to empty and refill — there’s no lid to mess with, you just lift up and go. The X8 doesn’t self-clean its washboard, however, and while it’s removable to make it easier to clean, I still had to get on my knees and scrub its base station after just a week of use.\n\nIt easily navigated fake dog turds and cables while sucking up oatmeal and Cheerios\n\n\nThe downside of roller mop bots is that they are big and heavy: the X8 weighs a whopping 12 pounds. Despite an ability to lift itself up to clear thresholds, the X8 isn’t as agile as smaller, lighter robot vacs. It struggled with the combo challenge of a large, tasseled, high-pile rug and spindly chair leg. Very few robot vacs tackle that one well, but it got stuck on the chair leg and sucked up the rug tassels. I ended up setting a keep-out zone so it could complete its job.\nThe integrated nature of the roller mop means the bot can’t remove it when it goes to vacuum carpet, as some mopping bots with pads can. It can lift it, but only 10mm, which isn’t going to work for the fluffiest rugs. The X8 does have carpet sensors, and you can choose to avoid them automatically, pass over them, or vacuum only. But its best carpet feature is the option to have it vacuum the carpets first, then mop everywhere else. \nOverall, the Deebot X8 is a stellar vacuum mop combo for anyone seeking a robot that will thoroughly scrub and sweep their floors. With high-end features at a decent price, the X8’s roller mop, slick navigation, and excellent obstacle avoidance will get the job done.\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nRoborock S8 Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSonic-mopping\nAuto-mop lift\nAI-powered obstacle avoidance\nDual-rubber roller brushes\nCarpet detection\n\nVery large and wide\nHave to wash the mop manually\nHave to refill the water tank manually\nNo heated drying\nLimited mop lift\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 $349.99 at Amazon (with Prime)\n $999.99 $499.99 at Amazon (with auto-empty dock)\n\nMultifunction Dock: No – just auto empty / Mop style: Vibrating pad / Mop washing: No / Mop pressure: 6N pressure, vibrates 3000 times a minute / Mop lift: Yes, 5mm / Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roborock S8 is a great vacuum featuring AI-powered obstacle detection, dual rubber roller brushes, and 6,000Pa of suction. These are all features you won’t find on most budget bots, and combined, they mean the S8 does a good job vacuuming hard floors and carpets. Then, its flat mop, which vibrates 3,000 times a second, is very effective at scrubbing hard floors. \nUnlike most robot vacuums in this guide, the S8 won’t automatically fill its water tank or wash its mop; you will have to do that work manually. However, it does have an extra-large onboard water tank, again a feature you won’t find on cheaper mopping bots, which means the mop gets sufficiently wet to be effective.\nThe S8 wasn’t designed as a budget bot; in fact, it was Roborock’s flagship model in 2023, but buying an older model like this can save you a lot of money while still doing a good job. Once $750 for the robot alone, now you can often find it for well under $500, and that’s with its auto-empty dock.\nOne of my favorite features of the S8 is that it can be set to mop only, and it does an excellent job, moving in a tighter “Z” pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though, and it doesn’t have any edge cleaning options, so it won’t mop as well along baseboards or under low furniture as the more expensive models.\nAnother great feature at this price is carpet sensing — the S8 can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings.\nThe S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). But if you’re good with a little more manual labor in exchange for cleaner floors, the S8 is a great option.\nRead more of my Roborock S8 review.\nBest midrange robot vacuum and mop\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $799.99 $699.99 at Walmart\n $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2.7L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop pressure: 2.2 lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, swinging motion / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni is an excellent mop vacuum hybrid with a full multifunction dock. Unlike the Roborock S8, it can wash its mop, drain, and refill its water tank. It’s also the cheapest model to offer dual spinning mop pads, and it has very good obstacle detection for this price range. \nHowever, the X10 has just 8,000Pa suction, no hot water washing, and smaller water tanks. While it has most of the same functions as the top-of-the-line mopping bots, it’s not quite as effective at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges, but this is less effective than mop extension found on the more expensive models. With its squarish shape, it gets into corners better than most of the round bots, but its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe Eufy performed very well in my mopping tests, eradicating dried stains with its 2.2 pounds of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. \nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nRead more of my Eufy X10 review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for a mix of hard floors and rugs\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $1399.98 at Walmart\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (3L) and drain/refill (4L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: Unknown  / Mop lift: Yes, 10.5 mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, mop extension Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have a lot of fluffy rugs or carpets as well as hard floors, the Dreame X40 Ultra is the best robot vacuum for you. It’s not quite as effective as a mop or vacuum as the Ecovacs Deebot X8, but it’s better suited for high-pile carpet and rugs because it can automatically drop and reattach its mopping pads during vacuuming, eliminating the risk of getting your rugs wet or stained. The Ecovacs X8 can only raise its mop 10mm, not remove it, so it struggles on high-pile carpets.\nAlong with dropping its pads, the X40 can also extend and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. The X8 can extend to an edge, but won’t get under those low cabinets or furniture. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it.\nHowever, because the X40 features dual spinning mop pads rather than a self-cleaning roller mop, it requires more frequent returns to clean the mops, which means it takes longer to clean your home. The X40’s spinning pads are effective at scrubbing your floors, but I found the X8’s roller mop to be better overall and more consistent.\nThe X40 can clean its washboard and features AI-powered smart dirt detection, which uses its cameras to identify spills, such as milk, or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it slows down and performs a more thorough cleaning. It also has an option to just mop. These are features the Ecovacs X8 doesn’t offer.\nDreame recently released the X50 Ultra, which adds 20,000Pa suction power and the ability to climb over higher thresholds. I’m currently testing this model.\nRead more of my Dream X40 Ultra review.\nBest robot vacuum and mop for hardwood floors\nEufy Omni S1 Pro\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLong roller mop\nSleek, futuristic design\nDual side brushes\nSquare shape helps with corners\n\nMiddling vacuum performance\nNo self-cleaning base\nNo mop extension\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $599.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2071111)\n $1299.99 $999.99 at Amazon\n $1499.99 at Best Buy\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (2L dirty, 3L clean) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes, warm water and hot air drying / Mop pressure: 10N, 170 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm /  Edge cleaning: No Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nIf you have mostly hardwood floors, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro is an excellent option. With its sleek, high-tech design and a long 11.4-inch roller mop, this product did an excellent job of keeping the hardwood floors of my main living area spotless. \nI found the Eufy’s longer roller mop to be slightly more effective than the Deebot X8’s, mopping evenly and getting up more dirt on its first pass. While there is no mop extension of edge mopping, its square shape does help it get into corners, and its dual spinning side brushes help pull in debris.\nHowever, its vacuuming prowess is middling; this really is a dedicated mopping robot. With just 8,000Pa suction power and a small rubber brush, it did a decent job of getting up debris, but left several flakes of oatmeal, thanks to its side brushes spinning the debris out beyond the bot’s reach. Its obstacle avoidance is also fairly average; it dodged larger items but struggled with cables. \nThe S1’s omni station is quite eye-catching, with a tall, futuristic design, and clear water tanks with glowing lights inside — although it might be considered an eyesore, depending on your style. Usefully, everything you need to interact with is located at the top, so there’s no need to bend down: a touchscreen display provides controls and the clean and dirty water tanks are easy to remove. \n\nIf you have tile or scraped wood floors, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better at getting into the crevices\n\n\nWhile it has a mop lift of 12mm (which is higher than the X8’s), it really struggled on my high-pile carpets, to the point where I had to set keep-out zones around them. \nLike the X8, the S1 self-cleans the mop with water jets as it’s working, and you can set how frequently it returns to the base station for a thorough clean with warm water before continuing to mop. It will also dry the mop with hot air, which is effective, if noisy.\n\n\n\n\nNeither the X8 nor the S1 have self-cleaning washboards, something Dreame offers. This is where the dock automatically washes the mopping tray in the dock – Dreame’s uses little wipers that go back and forth. It still needs to be cleaned eventually, but it does help keep the ick at bay for longer. \nThe S1 station’s debris filter got grungy fast and required manual cleaning, although this is fairly straightforward. After a month of use, I also had to disassemble the scraper and filter inside the bot, as well as remove the roller mop. This is something you’ll need to do for all mopping bots, but the Eufy’s was the most involved process, requiring me to disassemble multiple parts.\nIn my testing, I found that roller mops are great for most hardwood floors, but if you have lots of tile or scraped wood floors with grooves and nooks and crannies, a bot with oscillating mop pads will be better, as these do a better job of getting into crevices such as grout lines. \nBest robot vacuum and mop for tile floors\nNarwal Freo Z Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSuperb mopping\nGreat obstacle avoidance\nExcellent dirt detection\nSelf-cleans its washboard\nVery quiet\n\nMinimal mop lift\nEdge cleaning just okay\nUses a lot of water\nApp is unreliable\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Costco (with Accessory Pack Bundle)\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Amazon (with on-page coupon)\n $1499.99 $949.99 at Narwal (with code FRZU)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (2.5L) and drain/refill (4.1L dirty, 4.5L clean) / Mop style: Dual triangular spinning pads / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.6lbs at 180 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Edge cleaning: Yes, robot swing and fluffer / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut\nNarwal’s latest flagship mopping bot, the Freo Z Ultra, combines everything I loved about the Freo X Ultra, and adds better vacuuming, better object avoidance, an auto-empty dock (a first for Narwal), and a fluffy side brush to polish your baseboards. It also now comes in gray (white robot vacuums are not a good idea, unless you like cleaning your robot vacuum).\nWith its dual, triangular spinning mop pads (the unique shape helps avoid missing spots), the Freo Z is a great choice for homes with lots of hard floors, and especially tile. The oscillating mop pads are slightly better than roller mops at getting into grout lines and other crevices found on natural surfaces. The Freo Z’s downward pressure of 2.6 lbs meant it did a great job of scrubbing up dried-on debris, excelling in my dried ketchup test, even getting the red gunk up from tile grout.\n\n\n\n\nLike the Deebot X8, the Freo Z can recognize various floor materials, including tile, hardwood, and marble, and clean in the direction of the flooring, such as along the wood grain. Unlike the X8, it automatically adjusts pressure and “mopping humidity” based on the floor type, using higher humidity on tile floors than on wood floors, which can be impacted by excessive moisture. The Freo Z also self-cleans its station and has a removable tray, making maintenance easier.\n\nThe Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a bedroom\n\n\nVacuuming is much better than the Freo X, with the Z boasting 12,000Pa. While that’s not as high as the X8, the Freo Z is remarkably quiet, making it a great option for running in a primary bedroom suite where you may have a tile bathroom combined with carpet. \nAs with the X8, the Narwal doesn’t deal well with high-pile rugs, as there’s still only a 12 mm mop lift and no automatic mop removal. However, you can set it to perform one of four actions when it encounters a carpet: sidestep, cross it without cleaning, power boost to clean the carpet more effectively, or regular cleaning.\nThe obstacle detection is vastly improved and very good. A dual camera system allows the bot to not only see objects but uses AI to identify what they are and “decide” how to clean them. The best use of this I saw in testing is when there was a large puddle of water and it automatically switched to mop-only so as not to suck up liquid.\nSimilarly, Narwal’s dirt detect feature is very good. The bot goes back and forth over a stain or dirty area to ensure it’s clean. \n\n\n\n\nMy two biggest gripes with the Freo Z are that it uses a lot of water; it doesn’t have an onboard water tank, so it has to return frequently to refill — and could only clean my 800 square foot area once before I needed to refill the main tank in the dock. By comparison, the X8’s tank only needed refilling after three runs.  \nAdditionally, its app can be frustrating. It’s not easy to navigate, gets hung up between screens, and frequently disconnects from the robot. However, unlike the X8, the Narwal has controls on top of the station to start a clean, and once I had programmed a schedule, I didn’t find myself needing to use the app much at all. \nThe fluffy sidebrush feels more of a novelty than a necessity and doesn’t really seem to do much. Also, at this price, it would be nice if the Narwal offered a self-cleaning washboard. However, its washboard is removable, which makes it easier to clean manually.\nBest robot vacuum and mop with a plumbing hookup\nSwitchBot S10\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAlmost hands-free\nExcellent roller mop\nSelf-cleans\nBattery-powered water station\nSupports Matter\n\nBig and wide\nCan’t mop a second floor; it will only vacuum\nShort battery life\nLow suction power\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $499.99 at Switchbot (with code ROMT700)\n\nMultifunction Dock: Yes, auto, empty (4L) and drain/refill (two separate devices) / Mop style: Roller / Mop washing: Yes (during use), hot air drying / Mop Pressure: 2.2lbs at 300 RPM / Mop lift: Yes, 7mm /  Edge cleaning: No / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 6,500Pa / Vacuum brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcut, Matter\nThe SwitchBot S10 is a multitasking robot that hooks into your plumbing for a virtually hands-free sweeping and mopping experience. It’s one of the best robot mops I’ve tested, thanks to its self-cleaning roller mop and the fact that I never had to empty or fill its water tanks. These two features meant I could set it and forget it and have clean floors for weeks.\nMy other favorite feature of the S10 is its dual docking system. Its main dock is a charging / auto-empty dock, and there’s a separate battery-powered dock water station that you can put in a different room. This battery-powered dock is what makes the S10 the best plumbing hookup option, as it gives you much more flexibility with placement. Roborock, Dreame, and Narwal also have plumbing hookup docks, but they require power (I’ve not tested either of those yet).\nWhile the SwitchBot is a decent vacuum, it’s not the best. Its relatively paltry 6,500Pa of suction power is low compared to the competition, but the bot’s weight did help the rubber roller brush dig into the carpet and get up most of the cat hair.\n\nS10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats — which are the bane of most mopping bots\n\n\nOther downsides include the AI obstacle avoidance, which isn’t great. The S10 frequently got stuck on clothes left on my floor and bath mats, its battery life is short, and it lacks high-end features like dirt detection. There is also no edge cleaning function, meaning it didn’t do a great job along baseboards and around furniture.\nSwitchBot recently announced the SwitchBot S20 Pro, slated to launch this summer. The upgrade addresses some of my issues with the S10, including adding an extendable roller mop and side brush to add edge cleaning, as well as 15,000Pa. It also comes with the option of two all-in-one auto-empty base stations: one with a regular water tank you manually refill, or one that can hook into your plumbing. But it will also work with the battery-powered water station. I plan on testing this soon.\nRead my full SwitchBot S10 review.\nWhat I’m currently testing and what’s coming next\nAs mentioned before, Ecovacs recently released a successor to the Deebot X8 Pro Omni, aptly called the X9 Pro Omni ($1,299.99). It sports a roller mop like the X8 Pro, but the big difference is that the new model is designed to optimize airflow from intake to exhaust rather than relying solely on suction power. The upgrade could lead to better deep-cleaning, though we haven’t put it through its paces yet.\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and Saros 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to my pick for the best overall robot vacuum, the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed, which is a new option for Roborock. One uses dual spinning mops, the other a flat vibrating pad.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($1,999 $2,599), the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up light objects — including socks, tissues, and sandals. The arm isn’t the most reliable, and the vacuum occasionally struggles with correctly identifying items, but it’s otherwise an excellent model with 22,000Pa of suction power and dual spinning mop pads that it can remove on its own. Read our review.\nRoborock’s cheaper Qrevo Curv ($1,399.99 $1,599.99) also has dual spinning mop pads (which you have to remove) and can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The company’s Qrevo Slim ($899.99 $1,399.99) offers similar functions but features a new navigation system and lacks a lidar tower, allowing it to fit under low furniture.\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup features two models with dual spinning mopping pads and auto-wash docks. The new Roomba Plus 505 Combo Robot Plus AutoWash Dock ($849.99 $999.99) also offers heated mop drying, a feature the higher-end Roomba Combo 10 Max lacks.\niRobot also recently introduced an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705, the Roomba Max 705 Combo, which will be available for preorder in North America “later this year” for around $1,272 (€1099). Like the Max 705, it features dual rubber roller brushes that are resistant to tangling, along with AI-powered obstacle detection. It also comes with a unique roller mop cover that automatically deploys as it cleans, as well as a design that allows the mop to extend into corners and clean along wall edges.\nPriced at $999.99, Eufy’s new Robot Vacuum Omni E28 is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum with a rolling mop that can go over tough stains a second time if needed. The charging dock also includes a built-in deep cleaner that sprays water to tackle stains before sucking the mess into a separate wastewater tank.\nThe Narwal Flow — which is set to launch at an undisclosed price on August 7th — features the company’s first roller mop, which can also extend. We haven’t spent any time with it yet, but Narwal claims it can easily tackle thick, fluffy carpets thanks to its deep carpet boost mode.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection to work and can suck up wet spills as well as dry ones. Here’s some video of it in action.\nEureka’s J20 ($899.99 $1,099.99 ) features a very wide roller mop but only 8,000Pa suction. The forthcoming J15 Max Ultra ($1,299) can accurately spot liquids and automatically rotate its body to tackle wet spills with its dual spinning mopping pads. It’s an upgrade to the J15 Pro Ultra ($779.98 $999.99), which can identify colored liquids but not clear or white ones.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,199.99 $1,699.99) features a “motorized swing arm” that functions like a leg, enabling the robovac to climb over transitions up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra in this guide, only with higher suction power and a retractable lidar tower.\nThe Switchbot S20 ($799.99), which resembles the Pro model announced at CES earlier this year, is now available. It’s essentially the successor to our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum, the Switchbot S10, with an extendable roller mop / side brush and 15,000Pa of suction power.\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum mop ($699.99 $999.99) can lift itself up as high as 20mm to get over rugs and transitions. Its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags, either.\nPhotography by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, August 5th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of the Roomba Max 705 Combo.

While the newest model isn’t drastically different from its 10th-gen predecessor, it does offer a few key differences. One notable change is the increase to 128GB of base storage, up from 64GB. Additionally, the new model features Apple’s A16 Bionic chip, providing better overall performance when browsing the web, opening apps, and watching videos. That being said, the base iPad still doesn’t support Apple Intelligence despite the faster chip, meaning you can’t take advantage of features like the ability to generate images and text. It will, however, support iPadOS 26’s windowed multitasking feature when the update arrives later this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, the 11th-gen iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. Upgrading to 256GB or 512GB of storage will run you an extra $100 or $200, respectively, while the LTE model starts at $499. The base model recently dropped to $279 ($70 off) during Amazon’s most recent Prime Day event, proving that, if you’re patient, it’s possible to save a good chunk on the MSRP.

Here’s an insider tip: Skip the Apple Store, where discounts are almost nonexistent. Instead, your best bet is to check third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, which frequently offer deals on everything from the entry-level iPad to the powerhouse iPad Pro, making it possible to snag a bargain any time of the year.\nApple’s tablet lineup now includes six different iPads, which makes tracking deals across each configuration a full-time job. Fortunately, that’s exactly what we’re here for. Below, you’ll find the best discounts on every current model. Want something for basic web browsing? The entry-level iPad is currently down to $299 ($50 off). Looking for more power to play games and edit videos? The iPad Pro with M4 chip is going for $899 ($100 off). No matter which one you choose, rest assured that every model below is set to receive iPadOS 26 in the fall, which is the most significant update the iPad has seen in 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\n\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\niPad (2025)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349 $299 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)\n $449 $399 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)\n $649 $598.5 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)\n\nThe 11th-generation iPad remains the most affordable tablet in Apple’s lineup. While the newest model isn’t drastically different from its 10th-gen predecessor, it does offer a few key differences. One notable change is the increase to 128GB of base storage, up from 64GB. Additionally, the new model features Apple’s A16 Bionic chip, providing better overall performance when browsing the web, opening apps, and watching videos. That being said, the base iPad still doesn’t support Apple Intelligence despite the faster chip, meaning you can’t take advantage of features like the ability to generate images and text. It will, however, support iPadOS 26’s windowed multitasking feature when the update arrives later this year.\nCurrently, the 11th-gen iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. Upgrading to 256GB or 512GB of storage will run you an extra $100 or $200, respectively, while the LTE model starts at $499. The base model recently dropped to $279 ($70 off) during Amazon’s most recent Prime Day event, proving that, if you’re patient, it’s possible to save a good chunk on the MSRP. That said, there are great deals to be had throughout the year. For example, the aforementioned base configuration is currently down to $299 ($50 off) — its second-best price to date — at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.

The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable at handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The laptop’s battery lasted between eight and ten hours when we <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\">originally reviewed it</a>, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time and port selection is also more limited than newer models.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"m2-macbook-air\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\">M2 MacBook Air</a></h3>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip.

The old wedge-shaped look was replaced for a more squared-off design that’s still used by the current-generation MacBook Air. It has a 1080p webcam, which was a welcome improvement given the disappointing camera on the 2020 M1 model. It’s also much lighter and thus more portable as well, yet it retains features like MagSafe charging and Touch ID, as well as a nice display.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its age, the M2 processor inside of this machine is still powerful enough to handle many tasks, from common ones such as browsing to more complex and creative projects. Compared to newer, pricier models, this one unsurprisingly struggles with gaming. That being said, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/707106/cyberpunk-2077-mac-release-date\">it’s capable of running</a> <em>Cyberpunk 2077.</em> The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 launched with 8GB of RAM, but that configuration became unavailable last year when Apple made 16GB the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270669/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-16gb-ram-doubled-apple-intelligence-ai\">new standard</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While a well-rounded laptop overall, there is one key area where Apple’s M1 model is better: storage. The base M2 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23220299/apple-macbook-air-m2-slow-ssd-read-write-speeds-testing-benchmark\">actually slower</a> than its predecessor because it’s stored in a single NAND chip. This was corrected in subsequent MacBook Air models, so the slowdown is unique to M2 machines with 256GB of storage<strong>. </strong>Also, be aware as well that port selection isn’t great, and the included display notch — which is also found on both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros — can make using the menu bar more challenging until you get used to it. If that doesn’t bother you, however, you can get a configuration with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU and GPU for $699 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-starlight/6602762.p?skuId=6602762\">Best Buy</a>. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"m4-macbook-air\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review\">M4 MacBook Air</a></h3>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The M4 MacBook Air has a speedy processor, and double the RAM of previous models.

It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for $799 ($200 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-laptop-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6565862.p\">Best Buy</a>.

The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/OWC-Thunderbolt-Portable-Enclosure-Compatible/dp/B0DMTTTCM2\">external SSD</a> with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also get the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro with a 16-inch screen if you’d like to work on a larger display. </p>\n\n<p>Right now, the 14-inch M4 model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU is $1,299 ($300 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-black/6602741.p\">Best Buy</a> and $200 off at <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859560-REG/apple_mw2u3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>.

The laptop runs on a power-efficient ARM processor that doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 13.8-inch 2,304 x 1,536 120Hz screen supports Dolby Vision HDR (High Dynamic Range) and looks very nice. It has a large, precision haptic trackpad that gives you plenty of room to tap and swipe, an offers satisfying feedback no matter where you press it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The laptop has a pair of USB 4 ports, one USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port, plus a headphone jack. One of the concerns of using an ARM-based Windows PC has been software compatibility, but this model proves that’s no longer something to be as worried about. It runs Photoshop, and apps compiled for X86 processors work thanks to Microsoft’s Prism emulator. Be sure to check the compatibility of the specific Windows app you rely, though, as there’s still a chance they won’t work as intended. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even after our toughest tests, the battery lasted seven hours. That’s with 100 percent screen brightness, after downloading multiple Steam games, attending video calls, and running through multiple projects in Photoshop. Using the laptop with less power-hungry apps, including Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, and Chrome, the laptop used just 30 percent of its battery in seven hours. For the best battery life, you’ll want to stick to using native ARM apps when possible. If you want to make the switch to an ARM-based laptop to get some of the benefits MacBook users have had for years, the 7th Generation Surface Laptop is worth checking out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can get a 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition) with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD for $999 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Touchscreen-Snapdragon-Platinum/dp/B0CXL6B4QF\">Amazon</a>.

Di Benedetto chose Acer’s Chromebook Plus Spin 714 as one of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/713373/best-laptops-for-students\">best laptops for students</a> because it offers an excellent balance of power, battery life, specs, and value. It’s also made the cut in our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks\">best Chromebooks</a> because it supports Google’s Gemini smart assistant, and comes with a one-year subscription to Google’s One AI premium service. The current-generation laptop is a solid choice a year after it was released thanks in part to its Intel Core Ultra 5 Series 1 processor, which allows you to run Linux apps instead of being limited to software solely available through Google’s Play Store.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On to the specs: The laptop has a 14-inch 1920 x 1200 resolution touchscreen display, which can be flipped 180 degrees, so you can use the laptop as a large tablet if you prefer. The Plus Spin 714 has two Thunderbolt 4 ports and an HDMI port, which is an acceptable array of ports for a Chromebook. However, it only has 8GB of RAM, which will likely be a performance bottleneck if you intend to keep dozens of tabs open.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If your needs are relatively light and you don’t mind working mostly in the cloud instead of with local files, this is a solid computer. You can grab the Chromebook Plus Spin 714 for $629 ($170 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/acer-chromebook-plus-spin-714-laptop-with-google-ai-14-wuxga-touch-intel-core-ultra-5-115u-8gb-lpddr5-256gb-ssd-steel-gray/6576960.p\">Best Buy</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"E63Snk\">Asus laptop deals</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cKWGNO\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop\">Asus Zenbook S 16</a></h3>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Asus Zenbook S 16</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Asus Zenbook S 16 features AMD’s Ryzen AI mobile processors.

In our tests, the 16-inch 120Hz 3K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display emits vivid colors and excellent contrast. The laptop was more than capable of handling common tasks, including video chats using its 1080p webcam, music streaming, but its graphics and gaming performance is what really sets it apart from laptops in its size and price classes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This machine runs <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at around 77 frames per second with the resolution set to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 upscaling software turned on. The laptop isn’t designed for gaming, but it’s good to know it’s up to the task if you’re willing to turn down some graphical settings. The Zenbook S 16’s battery lasted 11 hours during our testing. However, the percentage indicator in the Windows taskbar would often fluctuate, making it difficult to pin down exactly how much juice was left. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can get a configuration of the laptop with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor for $1,299.99 ($500 off) <a href=\"https://shop.asus.com/us/90nb13m3-m00790-asus-zenbook-s-16-um5606.html?bdl=0\">from Asus</a> if you sign up for a free Asus membership.

The laptop’s display supports Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, so you shouldn’t see screen tearing or other graphical anomalies when playing games. The laptop has three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, an ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. You can use either the HDMI 2.1 port or Thunderbolt 5 ports to carry a 4K 120Hz video signal to a compatible TV or gaming monitor. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In case aesthetics matter to you, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has RGB lighting on its underside as well as a dot-matrix LED array that can display animations on its lid.

Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better suited for, say, college students, whereas others are ideal for gamers).\nThat’s why we’ve come up with this list of some of the best laptop deals available right now. In addition to the latest discounts, we’ll share each discounted model’s best features (and downsides) to give you more clarity during your shopping journey. And if you need to do more research, you can also check out our guides to the best laptops on the market and the top gaming laptops.\nThe best laptop deals\nApple MacBook deals\nM1 MacBook Air\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)\nThe 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $649 $599 at Walmart\n\nApple itself no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 — and hasn’t for years — but you can still get this solid laptop for $599.99 ($50 off) at Walmart. The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable at handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.\nThe laptop’s battery lasted between eight and ten hours when we originally reviewed it, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time and port selection is also more limited than newer models.\nM2 MacBook Air\n13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nApple’s 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip is a significant leap above the M1 model it succeeded, both in terms of design and performance. The old wedge-shaped look was replaced for a more squared-off design that’s still used by the current-generation MacBook Air. It has a 1080p webcam, which was a welcome improvement given the disappointing camera on the 2020 M1 model. It’s also much lighter and thus more portable as well, yet it retains features like MagSafe charging and Touch ID, as well as a nice display.\nDespite its age, the M2 processor inside of this machine is still powerful enough to handle many tasks, from common ones such as browsing to more complex and creative projects. Compared to newer, pricier models, this one unsurprisingly struggles with gaming. That being said, it’s capable of running Cyberpunk 2077. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 launched with 8GB of RAM, but that configuration became unavailable last year when Apple made 16GB the new standard. \nWhile a well-rounded laptop overall, there is one key area where Apple’s M1 model is better: storage. The base M2 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage is actually slower than its predecessor because it’s stored in a single NAND chip. This was corrected in subsequent MacBook Air models, so the slowdown is unique to M2 machines with 256GB of storage. Also, be aware as well that port selection isn’t great, and the included display notch — which is also found on both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros — can make using the menu bar more challenging until you get used to it. If that doesn’t bother you, however, you can get a configuration with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU and GPU for $699 ($100 off) at Best Buy. \nM4 MacBook Air\nApple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)\nThe M4 MacBook Air has a speedy processor, and double the RAM of previous models. It has a thin and light design, all day battery life, and still starts with 256GB of storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $799 at Amazon\n $999 $799 at Best Buy\n\nThe 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 is Apple’s latest thin and lightweight laptop, and it’s our top pick in The Verge’s guide to the best laptops right now. It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files. \nApple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine. \nYou can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for $799 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. If you need a larger screen, you can get the 15-inch MacBook Air with the same specs for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4\nThe entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1299 at Best Buy\n $1599 $1399 at B&H Photo\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1786.5 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1799 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1999 $1799 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\n16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2234 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2249 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe M4 generation MacBook Pros are Apple’s fastest laptops yet. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality. \nThe M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch. \nIf you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an external SSD with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also get the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro with a 16-inch screen if you’d like to work on a larger display. \nRight now, the 14-inch M4 model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU is $1,299 ($300 off) at Best Buy and $200 off at B&H Photo. You can get a 14-inch M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 12-core CPU, and 16-core GPU for around $1,786 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. The 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core CPU, and 20-core GPU is currently on sale for around $2,234 at Amazon and B&H Photo. \nMicrosoft Surface deals\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition\nThe 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is Microsoft’s closest rival to the MacBook Air, using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chipsets for exceptional battery life.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $999.99 at Amazon (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1399.99 $1099.99 at Best Buy (X Elite, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)\n\nWe chose Microsoft’s 7th Edition Surface Laptop as one of the best laptops you can get because it’s the top Snapdragon Copilot Plus PC we’ve tried yet. The laptop runs on a power-efficient ARM processor that doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 13.8-inch 2,304 x 1,536 120Hz screen supports Dolby Vision HDR (High Dynamic Range) and looks very nice. It has a large, precision haptic trackpad that gives you plenty of room to tap and swipe, an offers satisfying feedback no matter where you press it. \nThe laptop has a pair of USB 4 ports, one USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port, plus a headphone jack. One of the concerns of using an ARM-based Windows PC has been software compatibility, but this model proves that’s no longer something to be as worried about. It runs Photoshop, and apps compiled for X86 processors work thanks to Microsoft’s Prism emulator. Be sure to check the compatibility of the specific Windows app you rely, though, as there’s still a chance they won’t work as intended. \nEven after our toughest tests, the battery lasted seven hours. That’s with 100 percent screen brightness, after downloading multiple Steam games, attending video calls, and running through multiple projects in Photoshop. Using the laptop with less power-hungry apps, including Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, and Chrome, the laptop used just 30 percent of its battery in seven hours. For the best battery life, you’ll want to stick to using native ARM apps when possible. If you want to make the switch to an ARM-based laptop to get some of the benefits MacBook users have had for years, the 7th Generation Surface Laptop is worth checking out.\nYou can get a 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition) with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD for $999 ($100 off) at Amazon. A model with the Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $1,099.99 ($300 off) at Best Buy.\nAcer laptop deals\nAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\nAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 714\nAcer’s Spin Chromebook is configured with Intel’s first generation of processor with an NPU. It also has Google Gemini baked right into the OS, and if you sign up for a new Google One AI premium plan, your first year of service is free. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $629 at Best Buy\n\nVerge reviewer Antonio G. Di Benedetto chose Acer’s Chromebook Plus Spin 714 as one of the best laptops for students because it offers an excellent balance of power, battery life, specs, and value. It’s also made the cut in our guide to the best Chromebooks because it supports Google’s Gemini smart assistant, and comes with a one-year subscription to Google’s One AI premium service. The current-generation laptop is a solid choice a year after it was released thanks in part to its Intel Core Ultra 5 Series 1 processor, which allows you to run Linux apps instead of being limited to software solely available through Google’s Play Store.\nOn to the specs: The laptop has a 14-inch 1920 x 1200 resolution touchscreen display, which can be flipped 180 degrees, so you can use the laptop as a large tablet if you prefer. The Plus Spin 714 has two Thunderbolt 4 ports and an HDMI port, which is an acceptable array of ports for a Chromebook. However, it only has 8GB of RAM, which will likely be a performance bottleneck if you intend to keep dozens of tabs open.\nIf your needs are relatively light and you don’t mind working mostly in the cloud instead of with local files, this is a solid computer. You can grab the Chromebook Plus Spin 714 for $629 ($170 off) at Best Buy.\nAsus laptop deals\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nAsus Zenbook S 16\nThe Asus Zenbook S 16 features AMD’s Ryzen AI mobile processors. It’s one of the thinnest and lightest 16-inch laptops available and doesn’t cut corners on performance. It’s a mighty machine that can handle all sorts of heavy workloads with ease and grace.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Asus (Members Only)\n\nWe chose Asus’ Zenbook S 16 as another one of our top recommendations for students, but it’s a solid laptop for anyone who wants a large-screened Windows laptop. In our tests, the 16-inch 120Hz 3K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display emits vivid colors and excellent contrast. The laptop was more than capable of handling common tasks, including video chats using its 1080p webcam, music streaming, but its graphics and gaming performance is what really sets it apart from laptops in its size and price classes. \nThis machine runs Cyberpunk 2077 at around 77 frames per second with the resolution set to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 upscaling software turned on. The laptop isn’t designed for gaming, but it’s good to know it’s up to the task if you’re willing to turn down some graphical settings. The Zenbook S 16’s battery lasted 11 hours during our testing. However, the percentage indicator in the Windows taskbar would often fluctuate, making it difficult to pin down exactly how much juice was left. \nYou can get a configuration of the laptop with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor for $1,299.99 ($500 off) from Asus if you sign up for a free Asus membership. We signed up for the membership, and it took about five minutes from start to finish.\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\nAsus’ ROG Strix Scar 16 is a powerful gaming laptop configured with a 16-inch 2.5K 240Hz screen, Nvidia 5080 graphics card, Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, and 2TB of storage.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3299.99 $2999.99 at Amazon\n $3299.99 $2999.99 at Best Buy\n $3299.99 $3099.99 at Walmart\n\nIf you want to take a powerful gaming PC with you on the go, Asus’ ROG Strix Scar 16 is one of the best we recommend. It has a 16-inch 240Hz Mini LED display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600. The screen can’t quite match an OLED when it comes to rich contrast, but you get Dolby Vision HDR here, and its color accuracy impressed us in our tests. The laptop has larger keys instead of a number pad, which makes sense for a gaming-focused laptop. If you need a number pad, you can bring up a touch-sensitive one by clicking and holding the top part of the laptop’s large trackpad. \nUnder the hood, Asus fitted the ROG Strix Scar 16 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card with 16GB of dedicated video memory. The laptop’s display supports Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, so you shouldn’t see screen tearing or other graphical anomalies when playing games. The laptop has three USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, an ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. You can use either the HDMI 2.1 port or Thunderbolt 5 ports to carry a 4K 120Hz video signal to a compatible TV or gaming monitor. \nIn case aesthetics matter to you, the ROG Strix Scar 16 has RGB lighting on its underside as well as a dot-matrix LED array that can display animations on its lid. These features aren’t new, but each can add some flair to your setup. Right now, you can get the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 in its base configuration for around $2999.99 ($300 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. \nUpdate, August 5th: Updated pricing and availability, and added new deals on Apple’s MacBook Air with M4, the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro, the Asus Zenbook S 16, the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16, Microsoft’s 7th Generation Surface Laptop, and Acer’s Chromebook Plus Spin 714.","summary":"If you want a great laptop, you’re going to have to fork over a ton of money, right?

They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Attempting to cancel your service is a good way to see if you’ll be offered a cheaper monthly rate to stick around.

With the Hulu with Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus bundle, you’ll be able to access more than 90 live sports, news, and entertainment channels, as well as content from each of the streaming services.

But if you, like many of us, have more concurrent subscriptions than you care to admit, you’ll agree that keeping up with the latest stuff every month can get expensive. They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up.\nIf you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Attempting to cancel your service is a good way to see if you’ll be offered a cheaper monthly rate to stick around. Outside of that, several services offer promos at different times throughout the year, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie for less than it would typically cost you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Peacock deals\nThe best Hulu deals\nThe best Sling TV deals\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nThe best HBO Max deals\nThe best Netflix deals\nThe best YouTube TV deals\nThe best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals\nThe best Starz deals\nThe best Amazon Prime Video deals\n\nNote: keep an eye out for free trials and student discounts\nMost streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. However, you will likely have to provide your credit card information in advance, and you will be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar if you don’t want to be charged.\nSome streaming platforms offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your student eligibility through a sign-up form and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals.\nThe best Peacock deals\nPeacock Premium (annual subscription)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $7.99 at Peacock (monthly, with ads)\n\nPeacock is NBCUniversal’s streaming service, one that offers next-day programming from NBC (and Bravo). The platform also provides access to live sports programming, including Sunday Night Football and WWE, as well as movies and shows like The Wild Robot, Conclave, Wicked, Oppenheimer, Yellowstone, Teacup, The Office, Saturday Night Live, Rian Johnson’s Poker Face, and the The Office spinoff, The Paper, which debuts on September 4th.\nThe platform currently offers two plans: an ad-supported Peacock Premium tier for $10.99 a month (or $109.99 a year) or the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier for $16.99 a month (or $169.99 a year). Only the latter lets you download content for offline viewing. These new prices went into effect in late July for new subscribers, and current subscribers will continue paying the previous rate until August 22nd.\nIn terms of deals, things are pretty dry right now. You can grab a complimentary subscription when you sign up for a year of Instacart Plus ($99 annually or $9.99 a month). You can also get free access if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer with gigabit speeds or a Diamond or Platinum Rewards member. If you’re a first responder or a medical professional (and are alright with your credentials being verified by SheerID), you can get Peacock’s monthly plan for $3.99 per month, which is a nice perk.\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nDisney Plus, Hulu Bundle Basic\nThis bundle comes with ads and grants access to all of the shows and movies available in Hulu’s and Disney Plus’ library.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $10.99 at Disney (monthly, with ads)\n\nWith Disney Plus, you can stream a wide range of shows and movies, including Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, Deadpool & Wolverine, Andor, X-Men ‘97, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film. A monthly subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). The $15.99 per month service includes Dolby Atmos sound in content that supports it, as well as the ability to download TV shows and movies on up to 10 devices.\nFor just a dollar more, Disney offers an ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu. To enjoy an ad-free experience across both services, the cost is $19.99 per month.\nThere’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying $26.99 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus, though ESPN will still have ads). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you want all three.\nThat being said, there are other ways to save, particularly with carrier promos. Those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans, for instance, can get Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 a month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s existing Legacy bundle, you can also continue to enjoy ad-free Disney Plus, as well as ad-supported ESPN Plus and Hulu, for $15 per month ($6 off).\nThe best Hulu deals\nHulu and Disney Plus (with ads)\nHulu grants access to originals like The Handmaid’s Tale, as well as non-Hulu content like Shogun, The Bear, Futurama, Say Nothing, and Alien: Romulus.  T-Mobile also offering complementary access to the Hulu-ad supported plan when you maintain a qualifying Go5G Next line.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $9.99 at Hulu \n\nHulu offers both ad-supported and ad-free plans. No matter which you buy, you’ll be able to access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices, including originals like The Handmaid’s Tale and Sand Land, as well as other content, like Shogun, The Bear, Futurama, and The Veil. It’s also where you’ll be able to watch the King of the Hill revival when it lands on August 4th. The service also allows two people to stream simultaneously, and you can have up to six user profiles. However, subscribing to the ad-free plan means you won’t have to deal with commercials; You’ll also be able to watch downloads offline.\nThe ad-supported plan currently costs $9.99 per month, while the ad-free plan costs $18.99 a month. Hulu also sells ad-free and ad-supported bundles that include Disney Plus and / or ESPN Plus, which are cheaper than subscribing to each service individually. With the Hulu with Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus bundle, you’ll be able to access more than 90 live sports, news, and entertainment channels, as well as content from each of the streaming services. You’ll also be able to record live shows with unlimited DVR storage and take advantage of the same features the standard, ad-free, and ad-supported Hulu plans offer. The ad-supported Hulu with Live TV subscription is $82.99 a month, while the ad-free tier is $95.99 a month (though, it’s worth noting that, of the three services included, ESPN Plus will still have ads, even at this tier). Complicated, right?\nHowever, if you just want Hulu and don’t need the live TV version, you can subscribe to the ad-supported Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney Plus, for $10.99 a month. You can also add ESPN Plus for $16.99 per month, or get rid of ads and add live sports for $26.99 a month.\nIn terms of deals, students can subscribe to the ad-supported version for $1.99 a month or a bundle that combines Spotify Premium, Showtime, and ad-supported Hulu for $5.99 a month. Some wireless carriers are also offering customers discounts when they buy premium phone plans. As mentioned previously, those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans can get the Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 per month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s Legacy bundle, you can also continue to stream ad-free Disney Plus and ad-supported ESPN Plus / Hulu for $15 a month ($6 off). T-Mobile, meanwhile, offers complimentary access to Hulu’s ad-supported tier when you maintain a qualifying Go5G Next line. \nThe best Sling TV deals\nSling TV (one-month subscription)\nSling TV is a live TV streaming service featuring live and on-demand TV channels like CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network, and more.

You can also subscribe to a bundle that includes both Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which offers all the channels featured in the first two plans.\nSling is currently offering new customers a 50 percent discount on their first month of Sling Orange, meaning you’ll pay $23 instead of $45.99. The promo also applies to Sling Blue, although it’s slightly more expensive at $25.50, down from $50.99. You can also get one month of Sling Orange and Sling Blue combined for $33 per month instead of $65.99.
