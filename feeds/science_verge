Most are awash in RGB lighting and edgy designs geared towards capital-G Gamers, but there are also thinner, lighter options that are more portable and less showy. </p>\n\n<p>Our go-to recommendation that checks the boxes for most people is, and has been for a while, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. It’s a gaming laptop that doesn’t forget the “laptop” part. The G14 is a versatile machine for both play and work, and it travels exceptionally well.</p>\n\n<p>Other great, though pricey, recommendations include the big and heavy Asus ROG Strix Scar and Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, or the Razer Blade 16 for lots of graphics power in a thin and sleek design.</p>\n\n<p>The most important part of any gaming laptop, just like desktop PCs, is the graphics card. Laptop GPUs can’t stack up to full-size cards that reach much higher wattage in desktops, but that doesn’t stop the likes of Nvidia from making things a little confusing with the naming scheme on its RTX brand of GeForce cards. So keep in mind that, for example, an RTX 5090 laptop card doesn’t come anywhere near the performance of a desktop 5090. Desktops may always win out in raw performance, but gaming laptops are a simpler turnkey solution that can easily go places (yes, even the ones that feel like you’re toting around a cinderblock).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even more confusing: the same GPU in one laptop may not perform as well in another if it’s throttled by thermal constraints. We try to test a wide range of gaming laptops, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">regular laptops</a>, and these are the ones we confidently recommend.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"yzdsDK\">The best gaming laptop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/rogzeyphg14_solo.webp?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Balanced performance, battery life, and portability</li><li>OLED display</li><li>Programmable LED strip on the lid</li><li>Great keyboard and smooth trackpad</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Gets a bit hot and loud under load</li><li>Soldered RAM</li><li>Thermally throttles its GPUs</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g14-2025/\"> $1799.99 at <strong>Asus</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-270-16gb-lpddr5x-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white/6629420.p\"> $1799.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen 9 270, HX 370 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, RTX 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB, 32GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 1TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz, 500 nits / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 to 0.64 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 73Whr / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 3.31 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p>\n\n<p>Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 has been a favorite among <em>Verge</em> staffers for years now, and it remains our go-to pick for its balance of power and portability. It can be your full-time gaming machine as well as your commuter-friendly everyday laptop. Asus <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison\">redesigned it in 2024</a> and toned down its more playful aesthetics for a sleeker, refined look, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338219/blink-and-youll-miss-these-zenbook-duo-and-rog-zephyrus-updates\">for 2025</a> it just got a modest chip bump with RTX 50-series graphics and the ability to charge via USB-C on either side (but you still need to use its proprietary charger for max wattage).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It now starts at $1,799.99 instead of $1,699.99. But you get a little more for your extra money since even the base Zephyrus G14 comes with a lovely, high-res OLED display capable of a 120Hz refresh rate, and it still has a great keyboard and trackpad. Games play well on high settings, though due to the thin chassis, the G14 — and even its 16-inch sibling, the Zephyrus G16 — are known to get a little hot to the touch, and their fans are quite noisy.</p>\n\n<p>Zephyrus laptops are never going to offer quite the same performance as much thicker models, like the Asus ROG Strix or other chunkers running equivalent GPUs — they just don’t have as much thermal headroom. But if you want a jack-of-all-trades notebook that puts gaming at the forefront, the G14 (or G16, if you want to go bigger and have the budget) is unlikely to steer you wrong.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"u4ab2G\">The most powerful gaming laptop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>MSI Titan 18 HX AI (2025)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/TITAN18HXA20165-1024x1024-1.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Top-tier gaming performance in a laptop</li><li>4K Mini LED screen is massive, looks great, and gets very bright</li><li>Mechanical keyboard is loud but feels awesome to type on</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Astronomically expensive</li><li>Battery drains very fast, even during regular tasks</li><li>Fans get loud</li><li>120Hz refresh is half the speed of cheaper laptops with 2.5K OLEDs</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://us-store.msi.com/Titan-18-HX-AI-A2XWIG-616US\"> $4799.99 at <strong>MSI (RTX 5080)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://us-store.msi.com/Titan-18-HX-AI-A2XWJG-614US\"> <strike>$5799.99</strike> $5639 at <strong>MSI (RTX 5090)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1DWFQTX\"> <strike>$5799.99</strike> $5639 at <strong>Amazon  (RTX 5090)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX&nbsp; / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia Geforce RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 64GB, 96GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 2TB, 6TB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 18-inch Mini LED 4K (3840 x 2400), 120Hz display, 1,000 nits, 100 percent DCI-P3 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.9 x 12.08 x 1.26 inches / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 99.9Whr / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 7.93 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p>\n\n<p>The MSI Titan is your pick if budget isn’t a concern.

It’s got its share of RGB lighting, but it’s done a little more tastefully than the Asus. Meanwhile, the Strix Scar’s 2.5K / 240Hz screen is a Mini LED display that’s bright, colorful, and visually pleasing. It matches the resolution and refresh rate of the OLED on Lenovo’s Legion Pro 7i, but the OLED on the Lenovo is even better, with a punchier look. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a bit of a toss-up between these two: the Lenovo has the better screen and build quality, yet it lacks face or fingerprint unlocking. But the Asus is $200 cheaper, and I prefer the trackpad and better key spacing of its numpad-less design. You can’t go wrong here, so picking one based on small nuances like that or just whatever you can get a deal on is fair. (The Lenovo has dipped to as low as $3,099 at retailers like <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1875949-REG/lenovo_83f50052us_16_legion_pro_7.html/specs\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and a savings of $400 is significant.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"csm3NI\">The best budget gaming laptop</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>HP Victus 15 (2025, RTX 4050)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24164223/226385_HP_Victus_15_MChin_0017.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Best Gaming Laptop 2023: HP Victus 15\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Good pricing</li><li>AMD or Intel CPU options</li><li>RTX 4050 is fine for 1080p gaming</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>16:9 aspect ratio is outdated</li><li>Not a ton of ports, and only one of them is USB-C</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-victus-15-6-144hz-full-hd-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-7445hs-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4050-512gb-ssd-mica-silver/6623881.p?skuId=6623881\"> $899.99 at <strong>Best Buy (AMD)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/victus-gaming-laptop-15-fa2047nr\"> <strike>$1149.99</strike> $849.99 at <strong>HP (Intel)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong><sub><em>CPU:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> AMD Ryzen 7 7445HS, Intel Core i5-13420H / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>GPU: </em></sub></strong><em><sub>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>RAM:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 16GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Storage:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 512GB / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Display:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 15.6-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 144Hz, no touch option / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Dimensions:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 14.09 x 10.04 x 0.93 / </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Battery</em></sub></strong><em><sub>: 70Wh&nbsp; </sub></em><strong><sub><em>Weight:</em></sub></strong><em><sub> 5.06 pounds</sub></em></em></em></p>\n\n<p>Our previous pick among budget gaming laptops was the HP Victus 15 with an RTX 3050 GPU, which cost around $800 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23438982/hp-victus-15-gaming-laptop-review-specs-price\">in 2022</a> when it wasn’t on a steep sale for less.

Most are awash in RGB lighting and edgy designs geared towards capital-G Gamers, but there are also thinner, lighter options that are more portable and less showy. \nOur go-to recommendation that checks the boxes for most people is, and has been for a while, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14. It’s a gaming laptop that doesn’t forget the “laptop” part. The G14 is a versatile machine for both play and work, and it travels exceptionally well.\nOther great, though pricey, recommendations include the big and heavy Asus ROG Strix Scar and Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, or the Razer Blade 16 for lots of graphics power in a thin and sleek design.\nThe most important part of any gaming laptop, just like desktop PCs, is the graphics card. Laptop GPUs can’t stack up to full-size cards that reach much higher wattage in desktops, but that doesn’t stop the likes of Nvidia from making things a little confusing with the naming scheme on its RTX brand of GeForce cards. So keep in mind that, for example, an RTX 5090 laptop card doesn’t come anywhere near the performance of a desktop 5090. Desktops may always win out in raw performance, but gaming laptops are a simpler turnkey solution that can easily go places (yes, even the ones that feel like you’re toting around a cinderblock). \nEven more confusing: the same GPU in one laptop may not perform as well in another if it’s throttled by thermal constraints. We try to test a wide range of gaming laptops, as well as regular laptops, and these are the ones we confidently recommend.\nThe best gaming laptop\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nBalanced performance, battery life, and portability\nOLED display\nProgrammable LED strip on the lid\nGreat keyboard and smooth trackpad\n\nGets a bit hot and loud under load\nSoldered RAM\nThermally throttles its GPUs\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 at Asus\n $1799.99 at Best Buy\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 270, HX 370 / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060, RTX 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080 / RAM: 16GB, 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 120Hz, 500 nits / Dimensions: 12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 to 0.64 inches / Battery: 73Whr / Weight: 3.31 pounds\nAsus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 has been a favorite among Verge staffers for years now, and it remains our go-to pick for its balance of power and portability. It can be your full-time gaming machine as well as your commuter-friendly everyday laptop. Asus redesigned it in 2024 and toned down its more playful aesthetics for a sleeker, refined look, and for 2025 it just got a modest chip bump with RTX 50-series graphics and the ability to charge via USB-C on either side (but you still need to use its proprietary charger for max wattage). \nIt now starts at $1,799.99 instead of $1,699.99. But you get a little more for your extra money since even the base Zephyrus G14 comes with a lovely, high-res OLED display capable of a 120Hz refresh rate, and it still has a great keyboard and trackpad. Games play well on high settings, though due to the thin chassis, the G14 — and even its 16-inch sibling, the Zephyrus G16 — are known to get a little hot to the touch, and their fans are quite noisy.\nZephyrus laptops are never going to offer quite the same performance as much thicker models, like the Asus ROG Strix or other chunkers running equivalent GPUs — they just don’t have as much thermal headroom. But if you want a jack-of-all-trades notebook that puts gaming at the forefront, the G14 (or G16, if you want to go bigger and have the budget) is unlikely to steer you wrong.\nThe most powerful gaming laptop\nMSI Titan 18 HX AI (2025)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTop-tier gaming performance in a laptop\n4K Mini LED screen is massive, looks great, and gets very bright\nMechanical keyboard is loud but feels awesome to type on\n\nAstronomically expensive\nBattery drains very fast, even during regular tasks\nFans get loud\n120Hz refresh is half the speed of cheaper laptops with 2.5K OLEDs\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $4799.99 at MSI (RTX 5080)\n $5799.99 $5639 at MSI (RTX 5090)\n $5799.99 $5639 at Amazon  (RTX 5090)\n\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX  / GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / RAM: 64GB, 96GB / Storage: 2TB, 6TB / Display: 18-inch Mini LED 4K (3840 x 2400), 120Hz display, 1,000 nits, 100 percent DCI-P3 / Dimensions: 15.9 x 12.08 x 1.26 inches / Battery: 99.9Whr / Weight: 7.93 pounds\nThe MSI Titan is your pick if budget isn’t a concern. It starts at a ridiculous $4,799.99 with Intel’s flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU and Nvidia’s second-highest GPU, the RTX 5080. The RTX 5090 configuration costs $5,799.99 or more with expanded storage and RAM. The Titan pairs these flagship chips with a massive 18-inch 4K / 120Hz Mini LED screen that gets incredibly bright, along with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD.\nIt’s loaded with RGB (including an illuminated haptic trackpad), a mechanical keyboard by SteelSeries, five USB ports (two of which are Thunderbolt 5), and a four-speaker / dual-woofer sound setup. It can tackle most games you throw at it on ultra settings. The screen may not be as fast as other laptops with 2.5K / 240Hz panels, but 4K at 18 inches looks so crisp. You have to pay out the nose for this no-holds-barred experience, but the nearly eight-pound behemoth is about as powerful as laptops get right now.\nIn the past, our choice for this tier of laptop was Asus’s ROG Strix Scar 17 using one of AMD’s X3D chips. That model was especially unique since it was significantly cheaper (under $4,000). Perhaps the 18-inch MSI Raider with the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D and RTX 5090 could sway me away from the Titan, but we’ll have to try it out first. (At $5,099.99, the Raider isn’t exactly a budget pick either.)\nThe best mid-to-high-tier gaming laptops for most people\nAsus ROG Strix Scar 16 (2025, RTX 5080)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat graphics performance in the latest high-end games\nLots of ports and easy access to RAM / SSDs\nAnimated lid and wraparound RGB are fun\nVery good QHD / 240Hz Mini LED screen\n\nTypical gaming laptop issues (pricey, hefty, and not great battery life)\nCompetition offers OLED screens\nCustomizing lid animations is a pain\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3299.99 at Asus\n $3299.99 at Amazon\n $3299.99 $3199.99 at Walmart\n\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 / RAM: 32GB / Storage:  2TB / Display: 16-inch Mini LED 2560 x 1600, 240Hz display / Dimensions: 13.94 x 10.55 x 0.9 to 1.21 inches / Battery: 90Whr  Weight: 6.17 pounds\nYou don’t have to spend Titan money to land somewhere in the ballpark of excellent gaming performance. There are a few great options in the mid-to-high tier of gaming laptops, sporting RTX 5080 graphics (or the RTX 5070 Ti if you need to save a bit more). My top pick is the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16, followed closely by the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i.\nLenovo Legion Pro 7i (16-inch, Intel)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat performance at 2.5K and even at 4K on an external monitor\nBeautiful OLED screen\nOne of the best keyboards in this class of gaming laptops\n\nNo face or fingerprint unlock\nNumpad makes things slightly cramped, with off-center trackpad\nLenovo’s apps are slightly more invasive with notifications than others\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3499 $3099 at B&H Photo Video (RTX 5080, 2TB SSD0\n $3499.99 at Lenovo (RTX 5080, 2TB SSD)\n $2969.99 at Best Buy (RTX 5080, 1TB SSD)\n\nThe 16-inch ROG Strix Scar is decked out with a wraparound RGB light bar that creates a colorful underglow and a dot-matrix LED lid for adorning fun illuminated animations. The Strix Scar’s game performance is exceptional, with its RTX 5080 nearly matching the 5090 in the much thinner Razer Blade 16 — and for $1,200 less.\nThe Lenovo Legion Pro 7i is a similarly specced 16-incher, offering the same CPU and GPU in a better, metallic build. It’s got its share of RGB lighting, but it’s done a little more tastefully than the Asus. Meanwhile, the Strix Scar’s 2.5K / 240Hz screen is a Mini LED display that’s bright, colorful, and visually pleasing. It matches the resolution and refresh rate of the OLED on Lenovo’s Legion Pro 7i, but the OLED on the Lenovo is even better, with a punchier look. \nIt’s a bit of a toss-up between these two: the Lenovo has the better screen and build quality, yet it lacks face or fingerprint unlocking. But the Asus is $200 cheaper, and I prefer the trackpad and better key spacing of its numpad-less design. You can’t go wrong here, so picking one based on small nuances like that or just whatever you can get a deal on is fair. (The Lenovo has dipped to as low as $3,099 at retailers like B&H Photo, and a savings of $400 is significant.)\nThe best budget gaming laptop\nHP Victus 15 (2025, RTX 4050)\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood pricing\nAMD or Intel CPU options\nRTX 4050 is fine for 1080p gaming\n\n16:9 aspect ratio is outdated\nNot a ton of ports, and only one of them is USB-C\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 at Best Buy (AMD)\n $1149.99 $849.99 at HP (Intel)\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7445HS, Intel Core i5-13420H / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 / RAM: 16GB / Storage: 512GB / Display: 15.6-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 144Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 14.09 x 10.04 x 0.93 / Battery: 70Wh  Weight: 5.06 pounds\nOur previous pick among budget gaming laptops was the HP Victus 15 with an RTX 3050 GPU, which cost around $800 in 2022 when it wasn’t on a steep sale for less. It had a 60Hz screen and just 8GB of RAM, which feels a little paltry for gaming on Windows 11 in 2025. Now, you can get the same chassis with a 1080p / 144Hz screen, a newer RTX 4050 GPU, and either AMD Ryzen 7 7000-series or Intel 13th-Gen CPU for around $850 to $900.\nNvidia has recently announced its RTX 5050 laptop GPU, which is set to slowly trickle out into new laptops for about $999. We’ll have to see how that stacks up in future testing.\nThe Victus isn’t going to wow you with the best screen or highest-quality components for a keyboard or trackpad, but it does emphasize a solid graphics card in an affordable package. It’s the kind of laptop that will excel with live service games like Minecraft or Fortnite, as well as indie titles. Just don’t expect high or ultra settings on the latest AAA games. With the right expectations, a more inexpensive gaming laptop like the Victus can treat you well.\nA sleek 16-inch gaming laptop\nRazer Blade 16 (2025, RTX 5090)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat fit, finish, and build\nSlim and sleek design for a gaming laptop\nExcellent OLED screen comes standard\nVery good performance, especially in DLSS 4 supported games\n\nStarts expensive and gets expensive-er\nMiddling battery life\nThinness aside, minimal improvements over last year’s model\nA cheaper 5080 laptop may be money better spent\nThe matte black finish smudges easily, and the Razer lid logo is still a little cringe\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $4899.99 at Razer\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 9 365, Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 5060, 5070, RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5080, RTX 5090 / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / Storage: 1TB, 2TB, 4TB / Display: 16-inch OLED, 2560 x 1600, 240Hz / Dimensions: 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.59 to 0.69 inches / Battery: 90Wh / Weight: 4.71 pounds\nThe Razer Blade 16 has long been touted as the MacBook Pro for gamers, and after thickening up for a few years, it’s back to an ultra-thin chassis without much compromise to performance.

The Fire TV Stick 4K is an excellent streaming device that supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus, allowing you to enjoy sharp, vibrant picture quality on compatible 4K TVs. It also offers support for Dolby Atmos, DTS, and other HDR and surround sound formats, so you can experience more immersive audio whether you’re watching movies or gaming. It integrates well with Alexa and comes with an Alexa Voice Remote, too, so you can search for shows or adjust the volume using your voice.\nAmazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $174.99 at Amazon\n\nIf you’re looking for better sound than your TV’s built-in speaker can provide, Amazon’s Fire TV Soundbar Plus is down to an all-time low of $174.99 ($75 off) at Amazon. At 37 inches wide, it’s small enough to fit under most TVs, making it a good option for apartments or smaller living rooms. Inside, it features three speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers, along with a dedicated center channel designed to enhance dialogue clarity. It also supports Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and DTS True Volume, allowing a more immersive listening experience. It features four different listening modes as well — Movie, Music, Sports, and Night — which adjust the sound profile to match what you’re watching, whether you’re after loud, booming sound or a quieter, late-night vibe.\nEero Max 7 with the Eero Outdoor 7\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n\nWhether you’re juggling smart devices inside or working in the backyard, the Eero Max 7 router and new Eero Outdoor 7 deliver reliable, high-speed Wi-Fi wherever you are on your property. And right now, you can buy both at Amazon as a part of a bundle starting at $699.99 ($300 off), which is a new low price.\nThe Eero Max 7 is designed for high-performance streaming, gaming, and future-proofing your smart home setup. It features Wi-Fi 7 support and speeds up to 10Gbps, with coverage suitable for homes up to 2,500 sq. ft. per unit. For those looking to extend their reliable Wi-Fi signal beyond indoor walls, the Eero Outdoor 7 offers the same high-speed performance but is designed specifically for outdoor environments. It carries an IP66 weatherproof rating — ensuring it can withstand rain, dust, and extreme temperatures — while delivering coverage across up to 15,000 square feet.\nRing Doorbell Battery with Ring Indoor Cam\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $139.99 $69.99 at Amazon\n\nIf you don’t want to buy a Blink security camera, Ring also sells some great security devices that play well with both Alexa and other Ring gadgets. A few of these are on sale right now — including a notable deal that pairs a Ring Doorbell Battery with a Ring Indoor Cam 2, all for $69.99 ($70 off) at Amazon.\nThe battery-powered Ring Doorbell Battery is a basic 1080 buzzer that borrows a couple of features from the Battery Doorbell Plus, which is one of our favorite video doorbells. While it doesn’t have a removable battery, it improves on the older Ring Video Doorbell 2 with a 1:1 aspect ratio and a 150-degree field of view, giving you a full, top-to-bottom view of who or what is at the door. Like the Plus, it also supports color night vision and uses a PIR sensor for motion-activated recording.\nThe Ring Indoor Cam 2, meanwhile, is a basic 1080p camera that supports motion-activated recording, color night vision, and a built-in siren that can be triggered manually from the Ring app. One of its most notable features is the physical privacy shutter, which allows you to block the camera’s lens and disable the microphone. If you pay for a Ring Home subscription, which starts at $4.99 a month, you’ll also gain access to a host of other features, including an in-app SOS button that allows you to request police, fire, or medical help.\nJackery Explorer 1000 v2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $448.98 at Amazon\n $799 $449 at Jackery\n\nIf you’re looking for a portable power station for outdoor adventures or that inevitable power outage, the Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 is available for an all-time low of around $448.99 ($350 off) from Amazon and Jackery. The 23-pound power station is relatively lightweight and portable, with three AC outlets that can output up to 1,500W. It also boasts a pair of USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, and a DC car port, allowing you to charge phones, laptops, cameras, and even small appliances (including your mini fridge). It also charges significantly faster than prior models and boasts a handy LED light, making it a versatile companion for camping, road trips, and emergencies at home.\nMore ways to save\nYou can buy a Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam with a Ring Pet Tag for $44.99 ($44.99 off) at Amazon, which is a new low price. Ring’s Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam rotates 360 degrees on a motorized base, which you can control via the Ring app. The wired 1080p camera also offers a physical privacy cover — just like the second-gen Ring Indoor Cam — along with support for video and color night vision, two-way talk, motion detection, and a built-in siren. The Ring Pet Tag, on the other hand, attaches to your pet’s collar and links to a digital profile anyone can access via a QR code.\nThe Alexa Voice Remote Pro is now available for just $24.99 ($10 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, marking its lowest price to date. The backlit remote features a built-in remote finder, allowing you to quickly locate it using either Amazon’s Fire TV app or a compatible smart speaker. It also features customizable shortcut buttons that you can program to instantly launch your favorite apps, as well as compatibility with most Fire TV streaming devices and smart TVs. Read our review.\nAmazon is selling the Eero 6 mesh router for $64.99 ($15 off), which is one of its best prices to date. While it lacks Wi-Fi 7 support and isn’t as fast as the newer Eero 7 models, it still delivers up to 900Mbps and covers up to 1,500 sq. ft. It’s a solid, budget-friendly choice for basic streaming, browsing, and smart home use.\nYou can buy an Echo Glow at Amazon for $19.99 ($10 off), which is $3 shy of its lowest price to date. The 100-lumen LED lamp is designed primarily for children, and as such, it can cycle through multiple colors with just a tap, function as a visual timer, and automatically dim when it’s time for bed. It’s also compatible with Alexa, meaning you can control it with your voice when paired with a compatible Echo device.\nRight now, Amazon is offering a free month of Kindle Unlimited, which normally runs $11.99 a month. The subscription gives you access to more than four million e-books, along with thousands of audiobooks and digital magazines. Just remember to cancel our subscription before the trial period ends if you don’t want to be automatically charged at the end of the limited window.\nAmazon’s Luna Controller is on sale for $39.99 ($30 off) at Amazon, which matches its best price to date.

Busting out the vacuum <em>and </em>mopping can be tiring. That’s why I’m a big fan of robot vacuums, especially ones with built-in mops that can handle all the cleaning on their own. Speaking of, you can pick up the <strong>Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20</strong> at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCFNZF32?th=1\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eufy.com%2Fproducts%2Ft2280111%3Fvariant%3D44222902993082\">Eufy</a> for $399.98 ($300 off), matching its all-time low.

The all-in-one station can empty, wash, dry, and refill the C20 between cleanings. It can also wash then dry the mop, so the robovac doesn’t wind up smelling like a gym locker while it roams your house. A transparent water tank allows you to easily monitor water levels without having to open the all-in-one station.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It features two sweeping and mopping modules, each capable of 180 rotations per minute. That should be enough to remove most tough stains on your floors. Additionally, the Omni C20 features adequate suction (7,000Pa), a rolling brush, and a side brush, all of which allow it to tackle dirt, crumbs, and pet hair. Speaking of hair, the robovac includes a “pro-detangle comb,” which can loosen and remove tangled hair from the brush. That said, anti-tangle brushes can be hit or miss, so it’s always a good idea to clean it manually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While we haven’t had the opportunity to test the Omni C20, our experience with Eufy robovacs has been generally positive. We chose the <strong>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</strong> as the best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\">midrange robot vacuum / mop combo</a>, and the Omni C20 offers a similar suite of features. However, the Omni C20 doesn’t support obstacle avoidance, which means it may run over wires, socks, toys, and even pet messes. So, looks like you’ll still have a <em>little </em>bit of pre-cleaning to do.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other deals worth checking out</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The digital version of <strong>Super Mario Odyssey</strong> is down to $39.99 ($20 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-switch-digital/5933200.p?skuId=5933200\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/super-mario-odyssey---nintendo-switch/155621.html\">GameStop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-mario-odyssey-switch/\">Nintendo</a>, a rare sale on what remains one of the Nintendo Switch’s best titles.

Busting out the vacuum and mopping can be tiring. That’s why I’m a big fan of robot vacuums, especially ones with built-in mops that can handle all the cleaning on their own. Speaking of, you can pick up the Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20 at Amazon and Eufy for $399.98 ($300 off), matching its all-time low. This deal may be around for just a matter of hours.\nEufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $399.98 at Amazon\n $699.99 $399.98 at Eufy\n\nThe Omni C20 is one of Eufy’s newer vacuum and mopping combo units that offers several automated cleaning features to make your life easier. The all-in-one station can empty, wash, dry, and refill the C20 between cleanings. It can also wash then dry the mop, so the robovac doesn’t wind up smelling like a gym locker while it roams your house. A transparent water tank allows you to easily monitor water levels without having to open the all-in-one station.\nIt features two sweeping and mopping modules, each capable of 180 rotations per minute. That should be enough to remove most tough stains on your floors. Additionally, the Omni C20 features adequate suction (7,000Pa), a rolling brush, and a side brush, all of which allow it to tackle dirt, crumbs, and pet hair. Speaking of hair, the robovac includes a “pro-detangle comb,” which can loosen and remove tangled hair from the brush. That said, anti-tangle brushes can be hit or miss, so it’s always a good idea to clean it manually.\nWhile we haven’t had the opportunity to test the Omni C20, our experience with Eufy robovacs has been generally positive. We chose the Eufy X10 Pro Omni as the best midrange robot vacuum / mop combo, and the Omni C20 offers a similar suite of features. However, the Omni C20 doesn’t support obstacle avoidance, which means it may run over wires, socks, toys, and even pet messes. So, looks like you’ll still have a little bit of pre-cleaning to do.\nOther deals worth checking out\nThe digital version of Super Mario Odyssey is down to $39.99 ($20 off) at Best Buy, GameStop and Nintendo, a rare sale on what remains one of the Nintendo Switch’s best titles.
