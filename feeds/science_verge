While steeper discounts are not likely to arrive until next month, many of the current offers are already worth considering, especially if you&#8217;re a Prime member looking to score a deal on one of Amazon’s own devices or services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">From record lows on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F1BMM2B7\">security gear</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Explorer-Portable-Generator-Emergency/dp/B0D7PPG25F\">power stations</a> to a solid deal on what was already an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k/dp/B0BP9MDCQZ\">affordable streaming device</a>, these early discounts offer a great chance to save before the real deluge arrives on July 8th.

It’s also a meaningful upgrade over its predecessor, thanks to improved low-light performance, a wider field of view, and USB-C support. You can even use it outdoors given it carries an IP65 rating, though you will need to purchase Blink’s optional Weather-Resistant Power Adapter ($9.99) to do so.\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K (2023)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $49.99 $24.99 at Amazon\n $49.99 $24.99 at Best Buy\n $49.99 $28.99 at B&H Photo\n\nAmazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K is on sale for $24.99 ($24.99 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is its lowest price of the year. The Fire TV Stick 4K is an excellent streaming device that supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus, allowing you to enjoy sharp, vibrant picture quality on compatible 4K TVs. It also offers support for Dolby Atmos, DTS, and other HDR and surround sound formats, so you can experience more immersive audio whether you’re watching movies or gaming. It integrates well with Alexa and comes with an Alexa Voice Remote, too, so you can search for shows or adjust the volume using your voice.\nAmazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $174.99 at Amazon\n\nIf you’re looking for better sound than your TV’s built-in speaker can provide, Amazon’s Fire TV Soundbar Plus is down to an all-time low of $174.99 ($75 off) at Amazon. At 37 inches wide, it’s small enough to fit under most TVs, making it a good option for apartments or smaller living rooms. Inside, it features three speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers, along with a dedicated center channel designed to enhance dialogue clarity. It also supports Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and DTS True Volume, allowing a more immersive listening experience. It features four different listening modes as well — Movie, Music, Sports, and Night — which adjust the sound profile to match what you’re watching, whether you’re after loud, booming sound or a quieter, late-night vibe.\nEero Max 7 with the Eero Outdoor 7\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n\nWhether you’re juggling smart devices inside or working in the backyard, the Eero Max 7 router and new Eero Outdoor 7 deliver reliable, high-speed Wi-Fi wherever you are on your property. And right now, you can buy both at Amazon as a part of a bundle starting at $699.99 ($300 off), which is a new low price.\nThe Eero Max 7 is designed for high-performance streaming, gaming, and future-proofing your smart home setup. It features Wi-Fi 7 support and speeds up to 10Gbps, with coverage suitable for homes up to 2,500 sq. ft. per unit. For those looking to extend their reliable Wi-Fi signal beyond indoor walls, the Eero Outdoor 7 offers the same high-speed performance but is designed specifically for outdoor environments. It carries an IP66 weatherproof rating — ensuring it can withstand rain, dust, and extreme temperatures — while delivering coverage across up to 15,000 square feet.\nRing Doorbell Battery with Ring Indoor Cam\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $139.99 $69.99 at Amazon\n\nIf you don’t want to buy a Blink security camera, Ring also sells some great security devices that play well with both Alexa and other Ring gadgets. A few of these are on sale right now — including a notable deal that pairs a Ring Doorbell Battery with a Ring Indoor Cam 2, all for $69.99 ($70 off) at Amazon.\nThe battery-powered Ring Doorbell Battery is a basic 1080 buzzer that borrows a couple of features from the Battery Doorbell Plus, which is one of our favorite video doorbells. While it doesn’t have a removable battery, it improves on the older Ring Video Doorbell 2 with a 1:1 aspect ratio and a 150-degree field of view, giving you a full, top-to-bottom view of who or what is at the door. Like the Plus, it also supports color night vision and uses a PIR sensor for motion-activated recording.\nThe Ring Indoor Cam 2, meanwhile, is a basic 1080p camera that supports motion-activated recording, color night vision, and a built-in siren that can be triggered manually from the Ring app. One of its most notable features is the physical privacy shutter, which allows you to block the camera’s lens and disable the microphone. If you pay for a Ring Home subscription, which starts at $4.99 a month, you’ll also gain access to a host of other features, including an in-app SOS button that allows you to request police, fire, or medical help.\nAmazon Fire HD 10 (2023)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $139.99 $69.99 at Amazon (32GB with ads, refurbished)\n\nNormally $139.99, you can currently buy a refurbished Fire HD 10 tablet at Amazon with 32GB of storage and ads for $69.99. With its 10.1-inch HD display, octa-core processor, and 3GB of RAM, the Fire HD 10 is a solid budget slate for entertainment purposes. While it’s not as powerful as an iPad, it handles casual web browsing, reading, and light gaming well enough. Its 1080p screen is one of the best in Amazon’s lineup, too, while built-in stylus support and handwriting recognition mean you can also use it to take notes (though you’ll have to buy the optional Made for Amazon stylus separately).\nJackery Explorer 1000 v2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $448.98 at Amazon\n $799 $449 at Jackery\n\nIf you’re looking for a portable power station for outdoor adventures or that inevitable power outage, the Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 is available for an all-time low of around $448.99 ($350 off) from Amazon and Jackery. The 23-pound power station is relatively lightweight and portable, with three AC outlets that can output up to 1,500W. It also boasts a pair of USB-C ports, a single USB-A port, and a DC car port, allowing you to charge phones, laptops, cameras, and even small appliances (including your mini fridge). It also charges significantly faster than prior models and boasts a handy LED light, making it a versatile companion for camping, road trips, and emergencies at home.\nMore ways to save\nYou can buy a Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam with a Ring Pet Tag for $44.99 ($44.99 off) at Amazon, which is a new low price. Ring’s Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam rotates 360 degrees on a motorized base, which you can control via the Ring app. The wired 1080p camera also offers a physical privacy cover — just like the second-gen Ring Indoor Cam — along with support for video and color night vision, two-way talk, motion detection, and a built-in siren. The Ring Pet Tag, on the other hand, attaches to your pet’s collar and links to a digital profile anyone can access via a QR code.\nThe Alexa Voice Remote Pro is now available for just $24.99 ($10 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, marking its lowest price to date. The backlit remote features a built-in remote finder, allowing you to quickly locate it using either Amazon’s Fire TV app or a compatible smart speaker. It also features customizable shortcut buttons that you can program to instantly launch your favorite apps, as well as compatibility with most Fire TV streaming devices and smart TVs. Read our review.\nAmazon is selling the Eero 6 mesh router for $64.99 ($15 off), which is one of its best prices to date. While it lacks Wi-Fi 7 support and isn’t as fast as the newer Eero 7 models, it still delivers up to 900Mbps and covers up to 1,500 sq. ft. It’s a solid, budget-friendly choice for basic streaming, browsing, and smart home use.\nYou can buy an Echo Glow at Amazon for $19.99 ($10 off), which is $3 shy of its lowest price to date. The 100-lumen LED lamp is designed primarily for children, and as such, it can cycle through multiple colors with just a tap, function as a visual timer, and automatically dim when it’s time for bed. It’s also compatible with Alexa, meaning you can control it with your voice when paired with a compatible Echo device.\nRight now, Amazon is offering a free month of Kindle Unlimited, which normally runs $11.99 a month. The subscription gives you access to more than four million e-books, along with thousands of audiobooks and digital magazines. Just remember to cancel our subscription before the trial period ends if you don’t want to be automatically charged at the end of the limited window.\nAmazon’s Luna Controller is on sale for $39.99 ($30 off) at Amazon, which matches its best price to date. Although it was built primarily for Amazon’s cloud-gaming service, the gamepad offers support for both Bluetooth and USB-C connectivity, rendering it compatible with Android phones, Apple products, Fire TV devices, and PCs. It also integrates with Alexa, allowing you to issue voice commands directly through the controller when paired with a Fire TV device.","summary":"Amazon’s next Prime Day event hasn’t officially kicked off yet, but in classic Amazon fashion, the retailer has already dropped a selection of early deals ahead of its four-day sale.
