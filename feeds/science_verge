While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/15/24177306/apple-foldable-phone-ipados-18\">Imagine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/20/23730130/apple-iphone-13-mini-apple-phones\">I have my own</a>, personally.)</p>\n\n<p>As you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.</p>\n\n<p>If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#ueIawV\">The best Android phone overall</a></li><li><a href=\"#d1zQdW\">The best maximalist phone</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-android-phone-that-isn-t-huge\">The best Android phone that isn’t huge</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-lightweight-big-phone\">The best lightweight big phone</a></li><li><a href=\"#oV1Wae\">The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge</a></li><li><a href=\"#SbewYq\">The best foldable phone</a></li><li><a href=\"#W3yT1i\">Other Android phones worth considering</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ueIawV\">The best Android phone overall</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Google Pixel 9 (128GB)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25596782/DSC08149.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Google Pixel 9 on a pink and green background.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Updated design feels more secure in hand</li><li>Fast fingerprint sensor</li><li>Seven years of software and OS updates</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No telephoto camera</li><li>AI features are inconsistent</li><li>What is a photo?</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D7HWJDQM/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#038;psc=1\"> <strike>$799</strike> $599 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587819.p?skuId=6587819\"> <strike>$799</strike> $599 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://store.google.com/config/pixel_9\"> $799 at <strong>Google</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / <strong>Processor: </strong>Tensor G4 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 10.5-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,700mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 27W wired, 15W wireless (with Pixel Stand 2) / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Google’s hardware is better than ever, and the whole Pixel 9 lineup feels just as polished as anything you’d get from Samsung or Apple.

It’s also designed to go the distance, with seven years of promised OS updates, which very likely means you’ll outgrow the phone before Google stops supporting it.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/DSC09411_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.02498750624688,100,99.950024987506\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hQgZWo\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery\">Read my full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-android-phone-that-isn-t-huge\">The best Android phone that isn’t huge</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Samsung Galaxy S25 (128GB)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257552_Samsung_Galaxy_S25_review_AJohnson_0009.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>The last reasonably sized Android phone</li><li>Seven years of OS upgrades</li><li>Very good camera</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Samsung software is as cluttered as usual</li><li>AI is still a mixed bag</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP3DB4CW/\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s25-128gb-unlocked-silver-shadow/6612281.p?skuId=6612281\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $719.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://howl.link/m2yfz61urazzu\"> $799.99 at <strong>Samsung </strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Screen:</strong><i> 6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120Hz OLED / </i><strong>Processor:</strong><i> </i>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite<i> / </i><strong>Cameras:</strong><i> </i>50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery:</strong> 4,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP68</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you.

For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the <em>regular</em> S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257552_Samsung_Galaxy_S25_review_AJohnson_0005.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.02498750624688,100,99.950024987506\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default.

The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, on the other hand, is different. Thanks to its slim, lightweight design, the device provides a welcome reprieve from the countless chunky, heavy alternatives. It’s thinner and lighter than the Galaxy S25 Plus, making it <em>the</em> big phone you can actually slide into your pocket or evening bag without it protruding out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, what’s the catch? The S25 Edge’s battery life is fine. Not great, not terrible, but somewhere straight down the middle. To be fair, it held up admirably during a particularly strenuous workday, one complete with hours of screen time, mobile hotspotting, and live blogging, making it to bedtime with battery to spare. It also lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, though it does feature the same 200-megapixel main camera found in the S25 Ultra.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/257789_Samsung_Galaxy_S25_Edge_review_AJohnson_0005.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.012500000000003,0,99.975,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Compared to the S25 Plus (left) the difference is noticeable, but you feel the impact once you pick the phone up.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even with those compromises, the S25 Edge is a very capable phone that offers similar performance and durability to other devices in the S25 lineup. You’ll just have to be a little more aware of battery life as the day goes on; however, unless you’re frequently streaming video or playing graphics-intensive games throughout the day, the noticeably thinner, lighter design offers a nice change of pace.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-our-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/680383/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-battery-screen\">Read our Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oV1Wae\">The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>OnePlus 13</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25816847/257469_OnePlus_13_AJohnson_0001.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"The OnePlus 13 in blue with vegan leather back panel.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Excellent battery life</li><li>Six years of security updates</li><li>Strong IP rating for dust and water resistance</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Big phone is big</li><li>Not as many OS updates as Google and Samsung offer</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3/\"> $899.99 at <strong>Amazon (12GB RAM / 256GB ROM)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP8K352S/\"> $999.99 at <strong>Amazon (16GB RAM / 512GB ROM)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-black-eclipse/6609357.p?skuId=6609357\"> $999.99 at <strong>Best Buy (16GB RAM / 512GB ROM)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / <strong>Processor:</strong> Snapdragon 8 Elite / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>6,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 80W wired, 50W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP6</em>8 and IP69</em></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13.

If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes.

Probably not, especially one as expensive as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. But there’s no question that it’s the nicest book-style foldable we’ve used to date. Instead of the long and narrow form factor of older Fold series devices, Samsung reworked the Fold 7’s proportions to feature an outer screen with a 21:9 aspect ratio. The change — along with a thinner frame — makes the device feel more like a standard slab-style device than ever.</p>\n\n<p>Open the Fold 7 up, and you get a spacious inner display that’s perfect for multitasking and gaming. Being able to watch YouTube videos on one half of the screen and take notes in the other half is incredibly useful. That said, the hinge can feel stiff when opening the phone, almost like you’re prying it open. The Fold 7 also features one of the largest camera bumps we’ve encountered in a phone, making the device sit crooked on flat surfaces. That’s one of the compromises you make with such a thin foldable.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257857_Samsung_Galaxy_Z_Fold_7_review_AJohnson_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.012500000000003,0,99.975,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The outer display’s reworked proportions make it feel like a normal slab-style phone.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Meanwhile, factors like outer screen sharpness, camera system quality, durability, and battery life all fall short of what you get from the more affordable Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.

It boasts a 6.67-inch OLED display, a generous 5,150mAh capacity battery, and a Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chipset, which is on the lower end of the flagship spectrum. It also looks different from previous Nothing devices. Instead of the iconic light strips on the back that glow and flash, the Nothing 3 features a small dot-matrix LED display that can show pictures and icons. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/mobile/709093/nothing-phone-3-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7JTH9GK?th=1\">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is Samsung’s other new foldable device. Unlike previous Flip series devices, the company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. The larger screen is a joy to use, making it much easier to quickly respond to texts and manage full apps. While the design is a big upgrade, the device still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, raising concerns about how the device will hold up over time. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/715325/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Fold-Smartphone/dp/B0D7V1J2Y1/\">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> was our previous pick for the best foldable phone, and it remains a great option for anyone looking to jump into the foldable market. Like the Z Fold 7, it offers a more slab-style form factor when it’s closed and a spacious inner screen when it’s open. As great as it is, the 9 Pro Fold has a slightly downgraded camera system compared to other Pixel 9 devices. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so even a small amount of dust has the potential to cause significant damage to the hinge. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24237586/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-screen-camera-battery\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Google’s Pixel 10 series — which will likely include a&nbsp;regular Pixel 10, a Pro, a Pro XL, and a Pro Fold — is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/708363/google-pixel-10-made-by-google-event-date\">expected to be shown off</a> at a Made by Google event on August 20th.

While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! Imagine.\nOn the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.)\nAs you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.\nIf you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations. \nWith that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal. \nHowever you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Android phone overall\nThe best maximalist phone\nThe best Android phone that isn’t huge\nThe best lightweight big phone\nThe best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge\nThe best foldable phone\nOther Android phones worth considering\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best Android phone overall\nGoogle Pixel 9 (128GB)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nUpdated design feels more secure in hand\nFast fingerprint sensor\nSeven years of software and OS updates\n\nNo telephoto camera\nAI features are inconsistent\nWhat is a photo?\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $599 at Amazon\n $799 $599 at Best Buy\n $799 at Google\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 27W wired, 15W wireless (with Pixel Stand 2) / Weather resistance: IP68\nGoogle’s hardware is better than ever, and the whole Pixel 9 lineup feels just as polished as anything you’d get from Samsung or Apple. But at $799 (and often less than that), the basic Pixel 9 is in a particularly appealing position, and if you don’t need a telephoto camera or the biggest screen, then this is the Android phone to get.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with some significant quality-of-life improvements like a faster fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone. The camera is as reliable as ever, and if you’re into AI photo editing tricks, boy does this phone have ‘em. There’s a new Screenshots app that acts as a place to store all of the information that would otherwise be lost at sea in your camera roll, and it uses AI to parse information out and make it searchable. Kinda handy.\nEven without AI, this is an excellent phone. It’s also designed to go the distance, with seven years of promised OS updates, which very likely means you’ll outgrow the phone before Google stops supporting it. Its potential for long-term value and the quality of the hardware make it an easy recommendation for anyone who just wants a nice Android phone that works.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9 review.\nThe best maximalist phone\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent screen\nImproved ultrawide camera\nRounded corners are comfier\n\nExpensive\nBulky\nAI is (still) hit or miss\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299.99 $999.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1299.99 $1099.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1299.99 at Samsung(256GB)\n\nScreen: 6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather resistance: IP68\nThere’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy.\nThe newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents.\nAll of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.\nRead my full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nThe best Android phone that isn’t huge\nSamsung Galaxy S25 (128GB)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nThe last reasonably sized Android phone\nSeven years of OS upgrades\nVery good camera\n\nSamsung software is as cluttered as usual\nAI is still a mixed bag\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $799.99 $719.99 at Best Buy\n $799.99 at Samsung \n\nScreen: 6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nMost people like a big phone, and I get that.

But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.\nThe Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit much, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.\nRead my full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nThe best lightweight big phone\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLike a regular phone, but slim\nSurprisingly lightweight\nBattery life isn’t as bad as I feared\n\nNo telephoto camera\nBattery life not as strong as a standard phone\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099.99 $990 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1219.99 $1099.99 at Amazon (512GB)\n $1219.99 $1119.99 at Best Buy (512GB)\n\nScreen: 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main camera with OIS, 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, 12-megapixel f/2.2 selfie / Battery: 3,900mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nBig phones have a tendency to, well, look and feel big. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, on the other hand, is different. Thanks to its slim, lightweight design, the device provides a welcome reprieve from the countless chunky, heavy alternatives. It’s thinner and lighter than the Galaxy S25 Plus, making it the big phone you can actually slide into your pocket or evening bag without it protruding out.\nSo, what’s the catch? The S25 Edge’s battery life is fine. Not great, not terrible, but somewhere straight down the middle. To be fair, it held up admirably during a particularly strenuous workday, one complete with hours of screen time, mobile hotspotting, and live blogging, making it to bedtime with battery to spare. It also lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, though it does feature the same 200-megapixel main camera found in the S25 Ultra.\nEven with those compromises, the S25 Edge is a very capable phone that offers similar performance and durability to other devices in the S25 lineup. You’ll just have to be a little more aware of battery life as the day goes on; however, unless you’re frequently streaming video or playing graphics-intensive games throughout the day, the noticeably thinner, lighter design offers a nice change of pace.\nRead our Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge review.\nThe best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge\nOnePlus 13\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent battery life\nSix years of security updates\nStrong IP rating for dust and water resistance\n\nBig phone is big\nNot as many OS updates as Google and Samsung offer\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 at Amazon (12GB RAM / 256GB ROM)\n $999.99 at Amazon (16GB RAM / 512GB ROM)\n $999.99 at Best Buy (16GB RAM / 512GB ROM)\n\nScreen: 6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 and IP69\nThere are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.\nThe OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.\nRead my full OnePlus 13 review.\nThe best foldable phone\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRidiculously slim and light for a foldable\nAll-day battery with moderate use\nOuter screen finally feels normal\n\nIt’s $2,000\nDurability still a concern\nCamera bump makes it wobble on a table\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1999.99 at Amazon\n $1999.99 at Best Buy\n $1999.99 at Walmart\n\nScreen: 8-inch, 1968p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.5-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,400mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48\nDoes anyone truly need a folding phone? Probably not, especially one as expensive as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. But there’s no question that it’s the nicest book-style foldable we’ve used to date. Instead of the long and narrow form factor of older Fold series devices, Samsung reworked the Fold 7’s proportions to feature an outer screen with a 21:9 aspect ratio. The change — along with a thinner frame — makes the device feel more like a standard slab-style device than ever.\nOpen the Fold 7 up, and you get a spacious inner display that’s perfect for multitasking and gaming. Being able to watch YouTube videos on one half of the screen and take notes in the other half is incredibly useful. That said, the hinge can feel stiff when opening the phone, almost like you’re prying it open. The Fold 7 also features one of the largest camera bumps we’ve encountered in a phone, making the device sit crooked on flat surfaces. That’s one of the compromises you make with such a thin foldable.\nMeanwhile, factors like outer screen sharpness, camera system quality, durability, and battery life all fall short of what you get from the more affordable Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. That said, if you’re looking for something more than a traditional slab-style device, you won’t find a better, more luxurious foldable.\nRead our full Galaxy Z Fold 7 review.\nOther Android phones worth considering\nThere are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.\nThe OnePlus Open is also another good book-style foldable option. It’s thin and light, and the software includes some thoughtful approaches to multitasking — a crucial part of the folding phone experience. But it won’t be supported with software updates for as long as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Read our review.\nSpeaking of OnePlus, the company also recently launched the OnePlus 13R, a midrange phone with a big 6.78-inch OLED display and enough battery life to carry you through two full days on a single charge. That said, the $599 handset lacks wireless charging and full water resistance, both of which can be found on other budget-friendly phones for less. Read our review.\nThe Google Pixel 9A comes with some small but important updates over the 8A, including more robust water resistance and a slightly bigger, brighter screen. Better yet, those improvements don’t come with a price bump. With seven years of OS updates included, that’s a strong ROI. Read our review.\nThe Nothing Phone 3 is billed by the brand as its “first true flagship phone,” with a $799 starting price that competes directly with the iPhone 16, Galaxy S25, and Pixel 9. It boasts a 6.67-inch OLED display, a generous 5,150mAh capacity battery, and a Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chipset, which is on the lower end of the flagship spectrum. It also looks different from previous Nothing devices. Instead of the iconic light strips on the back that glow and flash, the Nothing 3 features a small dot-matrix LED display that can show pictures and icons. Read our review.\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is Samsung’s other new foldable device. Unlike previous Flip series devices, the company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. The larger screen is a joy to use, making it much easier to quickly respond to texts and manage full apps. While the design is a big upgrade, the device still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, raising concerns about how the device will hold up over time. Read our review.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold was our previous pick for the best foldable phone, and it remains a great option for anyone looking to jump into the foldable market. Like the Z Fold 7, it offers a more slab-style form factor when it’s closed and a spacious inner screen when it’s open. As great as it is, the 9 Pro Fold has a slightly downgraded camera system compared to other Pixel 9 devices. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so even a small amount of dust has the potential to cause significant damage to the hinge. Read our review.\nWhat’s coming next\nGoogle’s Pixel 10 series — which will likely include a regular Pixel 10, a Pro, a Pro XL, and a Pro Fold — is expected to be shown off at a Made by Google event on August 20th. Google’s next-gen flagships have been heavily leaked at this point, and the base model is expected to join the Pro options with three cameras (including a telephoto lens). The new Pro models, meanwhile, will distinguish themselves with an upgraded Tensor G5 chipset and more advanced AI features while retaining a near-identical design. Google may also reveal a completely dust-proof Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nUpdate, August 8th: Updated pricing / availability and added the Galaxy Z Fold 7 as our pick for “the best foldable phone”.

With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.</p>\n\n<p>Yet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, and Kodak.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#kfGfOn\">The best instant camera for most people</a></li><li><a href=\"#fSDErJ\">Best premium instant camera</a></li><li><a href=\"#aLU8Kl\">The best instant camera for social occasions</a></li><li><a href=\"#W8F3oS\">The best instant camera for retro fans</a></li><li><a href=\"#yddqEQ\">The best instant camera for portability</a></li><li><a href=\"#SYcVqE\">Other instant cameras to consider</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>All the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BWNYPCT1/\">Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12</a> as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<p>If you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B0C6D6GL2Q/\">Instax Mini Evo</a> is our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you’d like to print.

It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for those new to photography and kids.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24545177/236588_Fujifilm_Instax_Mini_12_SVasani_0003.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 photos of animals, nature, art, and drinks.\" title=\"Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 photos of animals, nature, art, and drinks.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;For an instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 produces vivid, relatively true-to-life photos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>For an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.</p>\n\n<p>However, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24724410/236588_Fujifilm_Instax_Mini_12_SVasani_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5749128919861,100,88.850174216028\" alt=\"A closeup of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 camera and its lens structure surrounded by photos it printed in the background.\" title=\"A closeup of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 camera and its lens structure surrounded by photos it printed in the background.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 features a new lens structure that’s fun and more intuitive to play with.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>You can also now zoom in a little easier thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter the Close-Up Mode in lieu of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new&nbsp;“Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).</p>\n\n<p>The Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it also doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fSDErJ\">Best premium instant camera</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23350933/BFARSACE_220328_5108_1.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"The Instax Mini Evo being held up with a hand against a dark background with cameras that are out of focus.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Great use of dials and buttons</li><li>Lots of printing flexibility</li><li>Good battery life</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Internal storage is limited</li><li>Micro USB port is annoying</li><li>No viewfinder</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B09M4DKBQ9/\"> $216.95 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1774544-REG/fujifilm_instax_mini_evo_black.html\"> $216.95 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-instant-film-camera-black/6494388.p\"> $216.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type: </strong>Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately)</em> <em>/ <strong>Film size:</strong> 2 x 3-inches /</em></em> <em><em><strong>Weight: </strong>285 grams<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Charging method: </strong>USB-C (on newer models) /<strong> Companion app: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Other features:</strong> LCD screen, smartphone printing</em></em></p>\n\n<p>One of Fujifilm’s newest instant cameras, the Instax Mini Evo, was a favorite of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22989946/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-instant-camera-review-test-photography\">my former colleague Becca Farcase</a> — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a brown version and <a href=\"https://instax.com/mini_evo/en/90th_anniversary/\">limited edition models in silver and gold</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to balk at its $216.95 price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23350937/BFARSACE_220328_5108_3.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table sideways with the large LCD screen and back mostly in view.\" title=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table sideways with the large LCD screen and back mostly in view.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Instax Mini Evo comes with a large LCD screen that doubles as a viewfinder and allows you to choose which photos to print.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Becca Farsace / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Becca Farsace / The Verge\" />\n<p>Unlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed out, which was helpful given neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 are particularly great at capturing dark environments.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23601818/svasani_220525_5251_0009.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table surrounded by photos it’s produced.\" title=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table surrounded by photos it’s produced.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Being able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>Of course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add some filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps available for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely on internal storage solely, you can only take 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"di2Ydc\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22989946/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-instant-camera-review-test-photography\"><strong>Read our Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo review</strong></a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"aLU8Kl\">The best instant camera for social occasions</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23611271/svasani_KodakMiniRetro3cropped.jpb.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 6</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Lets you print photos from your phone</li><li>Entertaining companion app</li><li>Comes with film</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>So-so image quality </li><li>Unable to store images</li><li>Not as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Compatible-Bluetooth-Technology-Laminated/dp/B084MKYMXC/?th=1\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $139.99 at <strong>Amazon (with eight sheets)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://kodakphotoprinter.com/products/best-instant-camera-kodak-mini-shot-3-retro\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $149.99 at <strong>Kodak (with eight sheets)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/KODAK-Mini-Shot-3-Retro-4PASS-2-in-1-Instant-Camera-and-Photo-Printer-3x3-inches-8-Sheets-Yellow/373093173\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $149.99 at <strong>Walmart (with eight sheets)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type: </strong>Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / <strong>Film size: </strong>3 x 3-inch square prints / <strong>Weight: </strong>467 grams / <strong>Charging method: </strong>Micro USB /<strong> Companion app: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/<strong> Other features:</strong> LCD screen, smartphone printing</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Whereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app allows you to apply frames, stickers, filters, and a plethora of customization options to photos, making the camera great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature within the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making this a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23601821/svasani_220525_5251_0012.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"The yellow and black Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro being held up sideways with a hand and a bush as the background.\" title=\"The yellow and black Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro being held up sideways with a hand and a bush as the background.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;With its feature-rich app, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro is more modern than retro.

It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of a film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; <a href=\"https://shop.kodakphotoprinter.com/products/kodak-photo-printer-mini-3-retro-film-cartridge-refill-pack\">you can currently pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99</a>, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than both Fujifilm’s and Polaroid’s.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23601823/svasani_220525_5251_0014.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"Two photos produced by the Kodak Mini Shot 3 that are relatively true-to-life but too oversaturated with a pink tint.\" title=\"Two photos produced by the Kodak Mini Shot 3 that are relatively true-to-life but too oversaturated with a pink tint.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>However, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint that can interfere with quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"W8F3oS\">The best instant camera for retro fans</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Polaroid Now Plus (second-gen)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24984865/236831_best_instant_cameras_you_can_buy_right_now_SVasani_0003.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Handsome, retro design</li><li>Prints dreamy, vintage-style photos </li><li>Several creative modes</li><li>USB-C</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Struggles in low light</li><li>Film takes up to 15 minutes to develop</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Generation-Bluetooth-Connected-Controlled/dp/B0BVNPW1PX/\"> <strike>$149.99</strike> $99.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-generation-2-polaroid-camera\"> <strike>$149.99</strike> $119.99 at <strong>Polaroid</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/polaroid-now-instant-film-camera-generation-2-white/6536336.p\"> $149.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type:</strong> Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / <strong>Film size:</strong> 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / <strong>Weight:</strong> 451.5 grams / <strong>Charging method:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Companion app:</strong> Yes / <strong>Other features: </strong>Lens filter kit, film counter</em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the camera for you. Compared to the other instant cameras on this list, it most closely resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 with its classic, retro-inspired design. Meanwhile, its square I-Type film prints and iconic Polaroid-style frame give photos a more authentically vintage look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus comes with a suite of modern features, including support for USB-C charging. It also offers Bluetooth and a companion app that boasts several creative modes, allowing greater photographic control. These include a remote shutter, a self-timer, and the “Polaroid Lab,” which lets you adjust the exposure and various color settings. The app also features a handful of shooting modes — including a manual option — and the camera comes with a set of five colored lenses you can snap onto the front. These were enjoyable to play with and allowed for more artistic expression.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s one thing the Polaroid Now Plus isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given how heavy, large, and awkwardly sized it is, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Plus, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you have to ensure it’s not exposed to light while developing. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24984866/236831_best_instant_cameras_you_can_buy_right_now_SVasani_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5637254901961,100,88.872549019608\" alt=\"Six photos produced by the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus.\" title=\"Six photos produced by the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The photos I took with the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus weren’t that true to life, but they did give off an old-school vibe that I found charming.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>If you’re looking for an instant camera that can easily print a good, clear photo without much effort on your part, this is not the camera for you. Of all the cameras on this list, the latest Polaroid Now Plus struggles with low-light environments the most. I could barely see images I took indoors, and I could only get the clearest shots when the light was directly behind me during the day — specifically, in the morning. Even these images weren’t as clear in comparison to Instax film, and both contrast and color saturation levels tend to be quite low.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, this gave my pictures more of a dreamy vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming. Given all these issues, I found it was easy to waste film, which proved expensive. After all, you only get eight I-Type sheets <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckOmBppUA3u?u1=verge\">for $16.99</a>, and that’s in addition to forking out $149.99 for the camera.</p>\n\n<p>Truth be told, however, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind the price, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the perfect camera for you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24984863/236831_best_instant_cameras_you_can_buy_right_now_SVasani_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"A closeup of a green second-gen Polaroid Now Plus held up against a brown background.\" title=\"A closeup of a green second-gen Polaroid Now Plus held up against a brown background.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is a good combination of old-school and modern but was way too big for me to comfortably hold with just one hand.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that being said, it’s worth pointing out that Polaroid launched the <a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\">$149.99 Now Plus Generation 3</a>. The new camera seems like it’s largely an iterative update, with a built-in tripod and four new colors to choose from instead of just three. It should also offer brighter, more accurate lighting in high-contrast scenes and improved depth perception, courtesy of upgrades to the ranging sensor, light meter position, and autofocus.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"yddqEQ\">The best instant camera for portability</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Polaroid Go (second-gen)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25382125/247082_Polaroid_Go_2_SVasani_0001.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Tiny and lightweight</li><li>Prints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid Now Plus</li><li>USB-C</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Struggles in low light</li><li>Film takes up to 15 minutes to develop</li><li>No Bluetooth support or companion app</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Go-Generation-Instant-Included/dp/B0CG7JG7N3/\"> <strike>$89.99</strike> $71.82 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/polaroid-go-generation-2-white/6562510.p\"> $89.99 at <strong>Best Buy </strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/go-polaroid-camera\"> $89.99 at <strong>Polaroid</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type:</strong> Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) /<strong> Film size: </strong>2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / <strong>Weight:</strong> 239 grams / <strong>Charging method:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Companion app:</strong> No / <strong>Other features: </strong>Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Whereas the Polaroid Now Plus is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It easily fits into the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it easily the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.</p>\n\n<p>Weighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Now Plus and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.</p>\n\n<p>At $89.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, even with its recent $10 price increase. Its film also costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about<a href=\"https://us.polaroid.com/products/color-go-instant-film\"> $19.99 for a 16-sheet pack</a>). The camera also sports a small number of upgrades over the last-gen model despite retailing for less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to spend money on AA batteries.</p>\n\n<p>Polaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference from one generation to the next. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go — like the Now Plus — produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Now Plus.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25382128/247082_Polaroid_Go_2_SVasani_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>Unlike the Now Plus, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25382127/247082_Polaroid_Go_2_SVasani_0003.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Polaroid Go is easy to hold with one hand.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>That said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that provides a more traditional instant film experience — one they can take advantage of just about anywhere for half the price of the Polaroid Now Plus.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SYcVqE\">Other instant cameras to consider</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"instax-mini-41\"><a href=\"https://instax.com/mini41/en/\">Instax Mini 41</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April, Fujifilm announced the $107.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/644752/fujifilm-instax-mini-41#comments\">Instax Mini 41</a>, the long-awaited follow-up to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22367999/fujifilm-instax-mini-40-review-price\">Mini 40</a>. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes outfitted with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which you can’t disable). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dmcgAS\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B0CXZQGL2D/\">Instax Mini 99</a></h3>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for an analog instant camera that’s more advanced, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B0CXZQGL2D/\">$216.95</a>, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Instax Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket and an aluminum extension column, as well as a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur while capturing fast-moving subjects.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, andMini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera and not a hybrid like the Mini Evo, meaning you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The new model also isn’t as simple to use as the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kodak-smile-plus\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KODAK-Effect-Changing-Sticky-Backed-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0CQMLV5S6/\">Kodak Smile Plus</a></h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KODAK-Effect-Changing-Sticky-Backed-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0CQMLV5S6/\">Kodak Smile Plus</a> is another hybrid instant camera you can use to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $99.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers. </p>\n\n<p>However, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app that’s similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software is not as snappy or feature-rich, it still allows you to add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it can often be found for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pJsALN\"><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1789993-REG/leica_19190_sofort_2_hybrid_instant.html\">Leica Sofort 2</a></h3>\n\n<p>From photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23902287/leica-sofort-2-instant-film-camera\">Leica’s Sofort 2</a> is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.</p>\n\n<p>The drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s hard to recommend at $399 since most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The user interface is easier to navigate on the Leica, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also like that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Ugwaku\"><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1775648-REG/fujifilm_16802814_instax_square_sq40.html\">Instax Square SQ1</a></h3>\n\n<p>While it didn’t make the cut, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21431103/fujifilm-instax-square-sq1-instant-camera-review-price-specs-features\">Instax Square SQ1</a> is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Instax Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and comes with a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at <a href=\"https://www.instaxus.com/cameras/instax-square-sq1/\">$159.95</a>, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.</p>\n\n<p>That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Now Plus and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.</p>\n\n<p>Fujifilm also sells the newer <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/14/23759847/fujifilms-instax-square-lineup-just-got-a-lot-more-retro\">Instax Square SQ40</a>. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at <a href=\"https://www.instaxus.com/cameras/instax-square-sq40/\">$199.95</a>. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"instax-wide-evo-hybrid\"><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1875107-REG/fujifilm_16840957_instax_wide_evo_instant.html\">Instax Wide Evo Hybrid</a></h3>\n\n<p>Fujifilm’s forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348502/fujifilm-instax-wide-evo-hybrid-instant-camera-photography-printer\">Instax Wide Evo Hybrid</a> is nearly identical to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786676/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-announced-price-release-date\">Instax Mini Evo</a>. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $379.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. While it’s currently available in Japan and Australia, it won’t be available in the US until September 16th.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Instax Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lens and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, unlike the Wide 400, it’s a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful perk that can cut down on wasted shots. However, at $379.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects like a dog or a hyper toddler.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"instax-wide-400\"><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/fujifilm-instax-wide-400-green-instant-camera/-/A-91347440\">Instax Wide 400</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $349 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $162.95 <a href=\"https://www.instaxus.com/cameras/instax-wide-400-instant-camera/\">Instax Wide 400</a> is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar photos to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"polaroid-flip\"><a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/flip-polaroid-camera\">Polaroid Flip</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/648398/polaroid-flip-instant-camera-sonar-auto-focus-multi-lens\">Polaroid Flip</a> is a new, $219.99 instant camera that introduces scene analysis, which helps prevent exposure and focus issues by flashing a red LED warning light through the viewfinder. That’s a handy addition, as Polaroid says the Flip has the most powerful flash of any of its instant cameras (though its intensity can be adjusted to prevent overexposing close-ups). In addition, the Flip features&nbsp;new autofocus capabilities powered by a sonar sensor that automatically selects from one of four lenses.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve just started testing the Flip, but so far, it’s exceeding my expectations. All Polaroid cameras struggle with low-light conditions, especially indoors, but the Flip handles those scenarios better than other cameras I’ve used. At the very least, the photos I’ve taken so far are sharper than I expected from a Polaroid camera, and I’m producing fewer wasted shots. That said, I’m still in the early stages of testing, so I’ll update this guide once I have more hands-on time with it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"polaroid-now-plus-generation-3\"><a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\">Polaroid Now Plus Generation 3</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polaroid launched the $149.99 <a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\">Now Plus Generation 3</a>, a sequel to our current pick for the best retro-inspired camera. The new model is nearly identical to the second-gen Now Plus, only it’s available in six colors and features a built-in tripod. It also benefits from autofocus improvements and a better light meter position, which, according to Polaroid, should result in better photos.<strong> </strong>I’ve only just gotten my hands on the third-gen model, so I can’t tell how it compares to its predecessor or the Polaroid Flip just yet, but I’ll be updating this guide with my impressions once I’ve spent more time testing it.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, August 8th:</strong> Adjusted pricing / availability,</em> <em>added Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 41 as a recommendation, and noted my initial impressions regarding the new Polaroid Flip.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, and Kodak.\n \n\nThe best instant camera for most people\nBest premium instant camera\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\nThe best instant camera for portability\nOther instant cameras to consider\nWhat’s coming next\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus and Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\nThe best instant camera for most people\nFujifilm Instax Mini 12\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nProduces relatively true-to-life photos\nTerrific ease of use\nVery affordable\n\nInstax film can get pricey\nMinimal creative control\nFlash can be overpowering\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $86 at Amazon\n $86.99 at Best Buy\n $86.99 at Target\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for those new to photography and kids.\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.\nHowever, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.\nYou can also now zoom in a little easier thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter the Close-Up Mode in lieu of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new “Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left.\nAll in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it also doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.\nBest premium instant camera\nFujifilm Instax Mini Evo\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat use of dials and buttons\nLots of printing flexibility\nGood battery life\n\nInternal storage is limited\nMicro USB port is annoying\nNo viewfinder\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $216.95 at Amazon\n $216.95 at B&H Photo\n $216.99 at Best Buy\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\nOne of Fujifilm’s newest instant cameras, the Instax Mini Evo, was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a brown version and limited edition models in silver and gold.\nIt’s easy to balk at its $216.95 price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\nUnlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed out, which was helpful given neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 are particularly great at capturing dark environments.\nAdditionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.\nOf course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add some filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps available for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely on internal storage solely, you can only take 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.\nRead our Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo review.\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\nKodak Mini Shot 3 Retro\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLets you print photos from your phone\nEntertaining companion app\nComes with film\n\nSo-so image quality \nUnable to store images\nNot as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.99 $139.99 at Amazon (with eight sheets)\n $169.99 $149.99 at Kodak (with eight sheets)\n $169.99 $149.99 at Walmart (with eight sheets)\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app allows you to apply frames, stickers, filters, and a plethora of customization options to photos, making the camera great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature within the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making this a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\nLike the Instax Mini Evo, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro comes with an LCD screen (albeit a much smaller one) you can use to decide whether or not you want to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of a film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; you can currently pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than both Fujifilm’s and Polaroid’s.\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint that can interfere with quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.\nNonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\nPolaroid Now Plus (second-gen)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHandsome, retro design\nPrints dreamy, vintage-style photos \nSeveral creative modes\nUSB-C\n\nStruggles in low light\nFilm takes up to 15 minutes to develop\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149.99 $99.99 at Amazon\n $149.99 $119.99 at Polaroid\n $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 451.5 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Lens filter kit, film counter\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the camera for you. Compared to the other instant cameras on this list, it most closely resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 with its classic, retro-inspired design. Meanwhile, its square I-Type film prints and iconic Polaroid-style frame give photos a more authentically vintage look. \nAt the same time, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus comes with a suite of modern features, including support for USB-C charging. It also offers Bluetooth and a companion app that boasts several creative modes, allowing greater photographic control. These include a remote shutter, a self-timer, and the “Polaroid Lab,” which lets you adjust the exposure and various color settings. The app also features a handful of shooting modes — including a manual option — and the camera comes with a set of five colored lenses you can snap onto the front. These were enjoyable to play with and allowed for more artistic expression.\nIf there’s one thing the Polaroid Now Plus isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given how heavy, large, and awkwardly sized it is, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Plus, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you have to ensure it’s not exposed to light while developing. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day.\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that can easily print a good, clear photo without much effort on your part, this is not the camera for you. Of all the cameras on this list, the latest Polaroid Now Plus struggles with low-light environments the most. I could barely see images I took indoors, and I could only get the clearest shots when the light was directly behind me during the day — specifically, in the morning. Even these images weren’t as clear in comparison to Instax film, and both contrast and color saturation levels tend to be quite low.\nAdmittedly, this gave my pictures more of a dreamy vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming. Given all these issues, I found it was easy to waste film, which proved expensive. After all, you only get eight I-Type sheets for $16.99, and that’s in addition to forking out $149.99 for the camera.\nTruth be told, however, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind the price, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the perfect camera for you.\nAll that being said, it’s worth pointing out that Polaroid launched the $149.99 Now Plus Generation 3. The new camera seems like it’s largely an iterative update, with a built-in tripod and four new colors to choose from instead of just three. It should also offer brighter, more accurate lighting in high-contrast scenes and improved depth perception, courtesy of upgrades to the ranging sensor, light meter position, and autofocus.\nThe best instant camera for portability\nPolaroid Go (second-gen)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTiny and lightweight\nPrints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid Now Plus\nUSB-C\n\nStruggles in low light\nFilm takes up to 15 minutes to develop\nNo Bluetooth support or companion app\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89.99 $71.82 at Amazon\n $89.99 at Best Buy \n $89.99 at Polaroid\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\nWhereas the Polaroid Now Plus is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It easily fits into the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it easily the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.\nWeighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Now Plus and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.\nAt $89.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, even with its recent $10 price increase. Its film also costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about $19.99 for a 16-sheet pack). The camera also sports a small number of upgrades over the last-gen model despite retailing for less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to spend money on AA batteries.\nPolaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference from one generation to the next. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go — like the Now Plus — produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Now Plus.\nUnlike the Now Plus, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.\nThat said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that provides a more traditional instant film experience — one they can take advantage of just about anywhere for half the price of the Polaroid Now Plus.\nOther instant cameras to consider\nInstax Mini 41\nIn April, Fujifilm announced the $107.99 Instax Mini 41, the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups.\nIt didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes outfitted with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which you can’t disable). \nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\nInstax Mini 99\nIf you’re looking for an analog instant camera that’s more advanced, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $216.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Instax Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket and an aluminum extension column, as well as a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur while capturing fast-moving subjects.\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, andMini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera and not a hybrid like the Mini Evo, meaning you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The new model also isn’t as simple to use as the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters. \nKodak Smile Plus\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera you can use to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $99.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers. \nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark. \nThat being said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app that’s similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software is not as snappy or feature-rich, it still allows you to add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it can often be found for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\nLeica Sofort 2\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s hard to recommend at $399 since most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The user interface is easier to navigate on the Leica, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also like that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\nInstax Square SQ1\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Instax Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and comes with a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.\nThat said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Now Plus and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\nInstax Wide Evo Hybrid\nFujifilm’s forthcoming Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $379.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. While it’s currently available in Japan and Australia, it won’t be available in the US until September 16th.\nUltimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Instax Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lens and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, it’s a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful perk that can cut down on wasted shots. However, at $379.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects like a dog or a hyper toddler.\nInstax Wide 400\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $349 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $162.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar photos to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\nWhat’s coming next\nPolaroid Flip\nThe Polaroid Flip is a new, $219.99 instant camera that introduces scene analysis, which helps prevent exposure and focus issues by flashing a red LED warning light through the viewfinder. That’s a handy addition, as Polaroid says the Flip has the most powerful flash of any of its instant cameras (though its intensity can be adjusted to prevent overexposing close-ups). In addition, the Flip features new autofocus capabilities powered by a sonar sensor that automatically selects from one of four lenses. \nI’ve just started testing the Flip, but so far, it’s exceeding my expectations. All Polaroid cameras struggle with low-light conditions, especially indoors, but the Flip handles those scenarios better than other cameras I’ve used. At the very least, the photos I’ve taken so far are sharper than I expected from a Polaroid camera, and I’m producing fewer wasted shots. That said, I’m still in the early stages of testing, so I’ll update this guide once I have more hands-on time with it.\nPolaroid Now Plus Generation 3\nPolaroid launched the $149.99 Now Plus Generation 3, a sequel to our current pick for the best retro-inspired camera. The new model is nearly identical to the second-gen Now Plus, only it’s available in six colors and features a built-in tripod. It also benefits from autofocus improvements and a better light meter position, which, according to Polaroid, should result in better photos. I’ve only just gotten my hands on the third-gen model, so I can’t tell how it compares to its predecessor or the Polaroid Flip just yet, but I’ll be updating this guide with my impressions once I’ve spent more time testing it.\nUpdate, August 8th: Adjusted pricing / availability, added Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 41 as a recommendation, and noted my initial impressions regarding the new Polaroid Flip.","summary":"Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera.
