It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life.

But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">best laptops</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\">M2-powered MacBook Air</a> from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning.

Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2024 in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port.

They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models.

It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the 2020 laptop starting at $599 ($50 off) at Walmart — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro.\nPurchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.\n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe best Mac Mini deals\n\nAlthough Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM1 MacBook Air\nThe M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while the redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air (which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our guide to the best laptops.\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $599 ($50 off), which is its lowest price to date.\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)\nThe 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $649 $599 at Walmart\n\nM2 MacBook Air\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads.\nIt does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops.\nThe M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $699 ($100 off). \nIt’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s in short supply at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M4 model.\n13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nM3 MacBook Air\nThe M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2024 in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port. Apple discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM last year and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\nRight now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is available in its entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is tough to find in stock. You can also find the 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors at Best Buy. Given the relatively small price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage and additional memory. \nAs for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air, you can buy it with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) at Best Buy.\n13-inch MacBook Air with M3 (2024)\nThe MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299 $1099 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nM4 MacBook Air\nAlong with an updated Mac Studio, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like.\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some good discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $799 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\n13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\nPowered by the new M4 chip, Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air is faster than its predecessor and offers double the base RAM. It can also now connect to two external displays with the lid open and features an improved Center Stage webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $799 at Amazon\n $999 $799 at Best Buy\n\n\n15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\nApple’s 15-inch MacBook Air with the M4 chip is nearly identical to its 13-inch sibling. However, it includes a six-speaker sound system, not four, and your choice of a free 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or 70W USB‑C Power Adapter.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 $999 at Amazon\n $1199 $999 at Best Buy\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.\nWe’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However, Best Buy is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 512GB, 14-core GPU for $1,599 ($300 off). \n14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (2023)\nApple’s previous-gen 14-inch laptop powered by the M3 processor uses a similar design to the pricier 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s Pro- / Max-series chips but is offered at a lower price with similar ports and less RAM.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1899 $1599 at Best Buy (18GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.\nDeals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,299 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,799 ($200 off) at Best Buy and B&H Photo.\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for around $2,234 ($265 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4)\nThe entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a new space black option.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1299 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1599 $1299 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1799 $1499 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 1TB SSD)\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\nThe 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1785.5 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $1799 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1999 $1799 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\nApple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro)\nThe 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a new 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2234.5 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2249 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThe newest Mac Mini in town are the M4-based models arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit Ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit Ethernet for another $100.\nRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $539 ($61 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $729 ($70 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nMeanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon starting at $1,263 ($136 off).\nApple Mac Mini (M4)\nThe latest Mac Mini features Apple’s upgraded M4 chips and a smaller build than the prior model.
