And, as Apple’s smart speakers use a fork of tvOS, it&#8217;s likely that the upcoming HomePod OS 26 will include 1.4 as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24028203/thread-group-fix-credential-sharing-thread-border-router\">Thread 1.4</a> brings a standard way for Thread border routers, such as <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102078\">Apple TVs and HomePods</a>, to join an existing Thread network, fixing the problem where <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23820078/matters-biggest-problem-apple-google-thread-border-router-interoperability\">border routers from different manufacturers set up separate networks</a> when they join your smart home. “We’re seeing a great shift toward Thread 1.4 among some major device, platform, and border router vendors,” Thread Group VP of marketing Ann Olivo told <em>The Verge</em>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, with tvOS 26 not arriving until the fall, and Google and Amazon’s adoption of Thread 1.4 coming next year at the earliest, those of us who like to mix and match our smart home hardware — maybe you have an Apple TV, an Eero router, and a Google Nest Hub — will have to wait until at least 2026 for a more stable and speedier smart home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Released in September 2024, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235097/thread-1-4-spec-launch-matter-smart-home-problems\">Thread 1.4</a> is the latest specification of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23165855/thread-smart-home-protocol-matter-apple-google-interview\">smart home protocol</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung\">Matter</a> runs on. Thread offers a low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol designed specifically for IoT devices like lights, locks, sensors, and more. The 1.4 spec dictates that when a border router is added, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yI5RmkF4ixYVkeGjr6hMD5YnTGEPK7LIyxVXh-UfmDs/edit?tab=t.0\">it will join the existing Thread network versus creating a new one</a> — regardless of brand or platform. So, for example, your new Echo Show 8 would join the network already created by your Apple TV.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/screenshot-2025-06-10-at-04-39-37.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,27.211947719311,100,45.576104561377\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Code in tvOS 26 indicates that the updated Apple TV 4K runs Thread 1.4.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Matter Alpha\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Matter Alpha\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thread-powered devices require a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23568091/matter-compatible-devices-accessories-apple-amazon-google-samsung#:~:text=Tuohy%20/%20The%20Verge-,Getting%20started%3A%20Matter%20controllers,-To%20use%20Matter\">Thread border router</a> to connect to the internet. Today, there are several options for border routers, including the newest Apple TVs and HomePods, higher-end Echo and Google Nest smart speakers, and some Wi-Fi routers, including Eeros. If you have a few of these devices, they may set up separate Thread networks, which can cause issues. The biggest being that you lose the extended range and reliability benefits of a unified mesh network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I currently have nine Thread networks running in my home. Samsung SmartThings has created three. My Nest network includes most of my HomePods and my Google TV streamer; my Apple network has a newer Apple TV and a Nanoleaf border router in it. I have three separate Eero networks, one with Eero devices in it and the other two with Echo devices in them. While my setup is not typical (I test smart home devices for a living), it does demonstrate what a mess this can create.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24349390/matter-csa-thread-group-wifi-alliance-interview-2025#:~:text=You%20mentioned%20sunsetting%20earlier%20versions%20of%20Thread.%20Does%20that%20mean%20that%20if%20you%20have%20a%20Thread%20border%20router%2C%20it%20should%20be%20on%201.4%3F\">Older versions of Thread are being sunsetted</a> to speed up the transition. “Thread 1.3 certification applications for Thread Border Routers will close December 31, 2025,” Olivo confirmed. “As of Jan. 1, 2026, Thread 1.4 will be the only specification available for Thread Border Router certification.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Apple poised to implement Thread 1.4 this fall with tvOS 26, I checked in with Google, Amazon, and Samsung to see where they were at. All are still on 1.3. However, Mark Benson, head of SmartThings US, said Samsung’s border routers will be on 1.4 “later this year.” Amazon spokesperson Melanie Garvey said they will bring support for 1.4 “across compatible devices next year.” Alex Sakhartchouk, a software engineer at Google Home, confirmed that they are actively working toward adding support for Thread 1.4 “in the future.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“As of Jan. 1, 2026, Thread 1.4 will be the only specification available for Thread Border Router certification.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sakhartchouk added that Google Nest Thread border routers already “do our best” to join existing networks by integrating with mobile Thread credential storage APIs on Android and iOS. Meaning, when you set them up with your smartphone, they should share credentials with an existing border router using the phone. “We share our credentials via these same mobile APIs to allow others to join our networks,” he said. This worked for me — when I set up the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24250684/google-tv-streamer-4k-review-smart-home-hub\">Google TV streamer</a>, it joined my existing Apple Thread network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While mobile credential sharing helps today, and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24289972/matter-smart-home-standard-1-4-spec-new-features-device-types#:~:text=Matter%E2%80%99s%20new%20solution%20for%20Thread%20network%20credential%20sharing%2C%20which%20lets%20the%20router%20securely%20store%20and%20share%20the%20credentials.\">Wi-Fi router-based solution</a> put in place by the Connectivity Standards Alliance in Matter 1.4 could help at some point, the most straightforward fix is border routers communicating with each other.

And, as Apple’s smart speakers use a fork of tvOS, it’s likely that the upcoming HomePod OS 26 will include 1.4 as well.\nThread 1.4 brings a standard way for Thread border routers, such as Apple TVs and HomePods, to join an existing Thread network, fixing the problem where border routers from different manufacturers set up separate networks when they join your smart home. “We’re seeing a great shift toward Thread 1.4 among some major device, platform, and border router vendors,” Thread Group VP of marketing Ann Olivo told The Verge. \nBut, with tvOS 26 not arriving until the fall, and Google and Amazon’s adoption of Thread 1.4 coming next year at the earliest, those of us who like to mix and match our smart home hardware — maybe you have an Apple TV, an Eero router, and a Google Nest Hub — will have to wait until at least 2026 for a more stable and speedier smart home.\nReleased in September 2024, Thread 1.4 is the latest specification of the smart home protocol that Matter runs on. Thread offers a low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol designed specifically for IoT devices like lights, locks, sensors, and more. The 1.4 spec dictates that when a border router is added, it will join the existing Thread network versus creating a new one — regardless of brand or platform. So, for example, your new Echo Show 8 would join the network already created by your Apple TV.\nThread-powered devices require a Thread border router to connect to the internet. Today, there are several options for border routers, including the newest Apple TVs and HomePods, higher-end Echo and Google Nest smart speakers, and some Wi-Fi routers, including Eeros. If you have a few of these devices, they may set up separate Thread networks, which can cause issues. The biggest being that you lose the extended range and reliability benefits of a unified mesh network.\nI currently have nine Thread networks running in my home. Samsung SmartThings has created three. My Nest network includes most of my HomePods and my Google TV streamer; my Apple network has a newer Apple TV and a Nanoleaf border router in it. I have three separate Eero networks, one with Eero devices in it and the other two with Echo devices in them. While my setup is not typical (I test smart home devices for a living), it does demonstrate what a mess this can create. \nOlder versions of Thread are being sunsetted to speed up the transition. “Thread 1.3 certification applications for Thread Border Routers will close December 31, 2025,” Olivo confirmed. “As of Jan. 1, 2026, Thread 1.4 will be the only specification available for Thread Border Router certification.”\nWith Apple poised to implement Thread 1.4 this fall with tvOS 26, I checked in with Google, Amazon, and Samsung to see where they were at. All are still on 1.3. However, Mark Benson, head of SmartThings US, said Samsung’s border routers will be on 1.4 “later this year.” Amazon spokesperson Melanie Garvey said they will bring support for 1.4 “across compatible devices next year.” Alex Sakhartchouk, a software engineer at Google Home, confirmed that they are actively working toward adding support for Thread 1.4 “in the future.”\n\n“As of Jan. 1, 2026, Thread 1.4 will be the only specification available for Thread Border Router certification.”\n\n\nSakhartchouk added that Google Nest Thread border routers already “do our best” to join existing networks by integrating with mobile Thread credential storage APIs on Android and iOS. Meaning, when you set them up with your smartphone, they should share credentials with an existing border router using the phone. “We share our credentials via these same mobile APIs to allow others to join our networks,” he said. This worked for me — when I set up the Google TV streamer, it joined my existing Apple Thread network.\nWhile mobile credential sharing helps today, and the Wi-Fi router-based solution put in place by the Connectivity Standards Alliance in Matter 1.4 could help at some point, the most straightforward fix is border routers communicating with each other. This should have been the approach from day one — but it looks like we’ll have to be patient a while longer.","summary":"There’s finally some good news for anyone battling multiple Thread networks while using Matter devices in their smart home — as long as you&#8217;re the patient type.

Starting at $159.99, it’s cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon ebook reader, which I’ll dive into later — while offering many of the same features. Those include a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels and an adjustable warm white frontlight, which make for a clear and enjoyable reading experience. The latter also conveniently improves sleep by cutting down on blue light that interrupts melatonin production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That warm white frontlighting is an advantage over the cool white of the $109.99 base-model Kindle, and unlike the base Kindle, the Paperwhite has IPX8 water resistance. The $&nbsp;199.99<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature/dp/B0C8RR4WN3/\">&nbsp;Signature Edition Paperwhite</a> also has an auto-adjusting frontlight and no lockscreen ads.

Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because Amazon makes it incredibly easy to buy and read its stuff.&nbsp;Its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon.</p>\n\n<p>There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite has lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 extra to get rid of them. It’s also too big to hold comfortably with one hand. Perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite’s biggest flaw, though — which it shares with all Kindles aside from Fire tablets — is that it’s not easy to read books purchased outside of Amazon’s store. Kindle ebook formats are proprietary and only work on Kindle.&nbsp;Unlike Kobo and other ebook readers, Kindles don’t support EPUB files, an open file format used by pretty much everyone <em>except</em> Amazon. So, for example, if you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore (or Barnes &amp; Noble or Google Play Books or many other ebook stores), you can’t easily read those books on a Kindle without using a workaround. There <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23842102/kindle-amazon-import-files-epub\">are ways to convert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle\">transfer file formats</a> so you can read on the Kindle and vice versa, but it’ll take a couple of extra steps.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you don’t buy your books elsewhere or you don’t mind shopping from Amazon, you’ll be more than happy with the Kindle Paperwhite.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"YXkzbE\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24326185/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2024-e-reader-review\">Read our Kindle Paperwhite review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4JJ8kh\">The best non-Amazon ebook reader</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / <strong>Weight:</strong> 199.5 grams / <strong>Screen area and resolution:</strong> 7-inch screen, 300ppi  (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / <strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB / <strong>Other features:</strong> Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support&nbsp;</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review\">Kobo Libra Colour</a> is an excellent alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, especially for readers outside the US or anyone who doesn’t want to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem. Kobo’s latest slate offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C support, and a 300ppi display — along with a few perks that make it more helpful and enjoyable to use.</p>\n\n<p>The color display is the most obvious. The Libra Colour uses E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which provides soothing, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. It’s not as sharp as reading in monochrome — the resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing content in color — but it’s a nice touch that makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant. Book covers and comics, while still muted, have an added layer of depth, even if the colors are nowhere near as vivid as that of a traditional LED tablet or as vibrant as the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24303322/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-review\">Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, unlike the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour works with a digital pen — the Kobo Stylus 2 (<a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-stylus-2\">sold separately</a>) — which lets you highlight text in various colors or take notes using Kobo’s integrated notebooks. You can also take advantage of some of the more advanced capabilities found in the Kobo Elipsa 2E, allowing you to solve math equations, convert handwriting into typed text, and insert diagrams. This lets the Libra Colour function as a mini notebook of sorts, though I wouldn’t use it as a primary note-taking device since the seven-inch display can feel cramped to write on.</p>\n\n<p>The color display is only part of the appeal, though. The Libra Colour doesn’t have the lockscreen ads on the base Paperwhite — and packs physical page-turning buttons, which feel more intuitive to use than tapping either side of the display as you have to do on Amazon’s modern e-readers. The speedy e-reader also supports more file formats, including EPUB files, and makes it much easier to borrow books from the Overdrive library system. Native support for Pocket, meanwhile, means you can read your articles offline if you’re someone who uses the long-standing bookmarking app.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25532400/247144_Kobo_Libre_Colour_SVasani_0005.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of a page in a book with a sentence highlighted in pink.\" title=\"A photo of a page in a book with a sentence highlighted in pink.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;You can highlight in color, too.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required for performing certain tasks. That gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more often than the Libra Colour. The Kobo can’t easily tap into Amazon’s vast library of ebooks, which can be frustrating if you’ve amassed a collection of Kindle titles over the years. It can be done, but you have to convert file formats using third-party apps, which is tricky and can take time.</p>\n\n<p>But if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Kobo Libra Colour will give you the best digital reading experience of all the e-readers on our list. It’s my personal favorite.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0JIBBD\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review\">Read our Kobo Libra Colour review.</a></h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5hvl2N\">The best cheap ebook reader</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Dimensions: </strong>6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Weight: </strong>158 grams / <strong>Screen area and resolution</strong>: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / <strong>Storage:</strong> 16GB / <strong>Other features: </strong>USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support&nbsp;</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SWV3BYH\">base-model Kindle</a> ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids&nbsp;— especially the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNVBQK38/\">Amazon Kindle Kids Edition</a> which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also comes with six months of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ftu/home\">Amazon Kids Plus</a>, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime).</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257516_best_ebook_reader_SVasani_0004.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle is one of the most pocketable e-readers you can get.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing you’ll find in <a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-clara-bw\">the entry-level Kobo Clara BW</a> and Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on Barnes &amp; Noble’s entry-level e-reader, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23188252/barnes-noble-nook-glowlight-4e-e-reader-ebook-review\">Nook GlowLight 4e</a> (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"zA7FKv\">The best ebook reader for taking notes</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Dimensions: </strong>7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / <strong>Weight: </strong>390 grams / <strong>Screen area and resolution</strong>: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / <strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB / <strong>Other features: </strong>Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support&nbsp;</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Of all the large ebook readers I tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as on a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural.</p>\n\n<p>The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document as opposed to on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a trade-off I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the Kobo Elipsa 2E comes with twice the storage (32GB) for the same price as the base Kindle Scribe. You <em>can </em>step up to the 32GB Kindle Scribe for $20 more or upgrade to 64GB for $40 extra. Yet given the Scribe’s limitations, I still recommend saving the money and buying the Kobo Elipsa 2E instead.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/236710_E_reader_Kobo_Elipsa_2E_SVasani_0004.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;You can doodle in the Kobo Elipsa 2E using a variety of ink shades, pens, and brushes.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading.  That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Fgo103&amp;xcust=__vg0115awD__24092328__________________\">Onyx Boox Go 10.3</a>, which lets you insert links to notes — lacks.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KmWfUt\">Other ebook readers that didn’t make the cut</h2>\n\n<p>There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"b1o7uf\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft-Signature-Edition/dp/B0CN3XR57P/\">Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a></h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24303322/amazon-kindle-colorsoft-e-reader-review\">Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition</a> is the first&nbsp;Kindle&nbsp;to feature E Ink’s color screen technology and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive&nbsp;Kindle&nbsp;model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. Amazon doesn’t offer a cheaper version of the Colorsoft like it does with the Paperwhite, which is available in standard and Signature Edition versions, but if you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft is your best option.<em> &#8211; Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"esAlmz\"><a href=\"https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-clara-colour\">Kobo Clara Colour</a></h3>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/4/24158251/kobo-libra-clara-colour-e-reader-review\">Kobo Clara Colour</a> — the successor to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle\">Kobo Clara 2E</a> — is worth a look. At $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23542918/kobo-clara-2e-ereader-review-amazon-kindle\">Kobo Clara 2E</a>, but I think it’s worth the extra $10.

It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps.

Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"n8mZDc\"><a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/nook-glowlight-4-plus-barnes-noble/1143603294/\">Nook Glowlight 4 Plus</a></h3>\n\n<p>In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23803227/barnes-and-nobles-forthcoming-e-reader-a-new-kindle-alternative\">Nook Glowlight 4 Plus</a>.

An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some really are pocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes.\nI’ve been using ebook readers for nearly a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the Pocketbook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone. \nFeatured in this article\n\n\nHow we test e-readers\nWhen testing a new ebook reader, I make sure to use it as my primary device for at least a full week. For those seven days, if not longer, that e-reader is my principal way of consuming ebooks, audiobooks, and most articles from the web (if applicable). If the device has note-taking capabilities, I’ll use it to annotate books and jot down various reminders, to-do lists, and notes. I’ll even use it for some light journaling, as well as doodling.\nOn average, I tend to read for about an hour a day — longer on weekends — either for work or to unwind at the beach, in bed, or in the bathtub. I buy books directly from each e-reader’s respective bookstore, borrow library books via Overdrive, and try to sideload various file formats to see how easy it is to do.\n\n\n\n\n\nComfort\nHow easy is it to use and read on? A sharp display and relatively fast performance are essential to an enjoyable reading experience, as are size and weight.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild quality\nSome e-readers come with different features, like waterproofing, which means you really can read anywhere. Others offer buttons that make using the e-reader more intuitive to use. \n\n\n\n\n\nSupported content types\nThere must be easy, direct access to a wide selection of digital titles, including audiobooks and various file formats.\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordability\nIs the price justified, given what the e-reader offers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Kindle\nThe best non-Amazon ebook reader\nThe best cheap ebook reader\nThe best ebook reader for taking notes\nOther ebook readers that didn’t make the cut\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best Kindle\nDimensions: 7 x 5 x .3 inches / Weight: 211 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support \nIf you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. Starting at $159.99, it’s cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon ebook reader, which I’ll dive into later — while offering many of the same features. Those include a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels and an adjustable warm white frontlight, which make for a clear and enjoyable reading experience. The latter also conveniently improves sleep by cutting down on blue light that interrupts melatonin production. \nThat warm white frontlighting is an advantage over the cool white of the $109.99 base-model Kindle, and unlike the base Kindle, the Paperwhite has IPX8 water resistance. The $ 199.99 Signature Edition Paperwhite also has an auto-adjusting frontlight and no lockscreen ads. It has wireless charging, which is a rare feature to find in an e-reader.\nAmazon is the largest online retailer in the world, and it dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because Amazon makes it incredibly easy to buy and read its stuff. Its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon.\nThere are downsides, though. The Paperwhite has lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 extra to get rid of them. It’s also too big to hold comfortably with one hand. Perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite’s biggest flaw, though — which it shares with all Kindles aside from Fire tablets — is that it’s not easy to read books purchased outside of Amazon’s store. Kindle ebook formats are proprietary and only work on Kindle. Unlike Kobo and other ebook readers, Kindles don’t support EPUB files, an open file format used by pretty much everyone except Amazon. So, for example, if you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore (or Barnes & Noble or Google Play Books or many other ebook stores), you can’t easily read those books on a Kindle without using a workaround. There are ways to convert and transfer file formats so you can read on the Kindle and vice versa, but it’ll take a couple of extra steps.\nHowever, if you don’t buy your books elsewhere or you don’t mind shopping from Amazon, you’ll be more than happy with the Kindle Paperwhite.\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite review.\nThe best non-Amazon ebook reader\nDimensions: 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / Weight: 199.5 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi  (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support \nThe Kobo Libra Colour is an excellent alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, especially for readers outside the US or anyone who doesn’t want to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem. Kobo’s latest slate offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C support, and a 300ppi display — along with a few perks that make it more helpful and enjoyable to use.\nThe color display is the most obvious. The Libra Colour uses E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which provides soothing, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. It’s not as sharp as reading in monochrome — the resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing content in color — but it’s a nice touch that makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant. Book covers and comics, while still muted, have an added layer of depth, even if the colors are nowhere near as vivid as that of a traditional LED tablet or as vibrant as the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition.\nHowever, unlike the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour works with a digital pen — the Kobo Stylus 2 (sold separately) — which lets you highlight text in various colors or take notes using Kobo’s integrated notebooks. You can also take advantage of some of the more advanced capabilities found in the Kobo Elipsa 2E, allowing you to solve math equations, convert handwriting into typed text, and insert diagrams. This lets the Libra Colour function as a mini notebook of sorts, though I wouldn’t use it as a primary note-taking device since the seven-inch display can feel cramped to write on.\nThe color display is only part of the appeal, though. The Libra Colour doesn’t have the lockscreen ads on the base Paperwhite — and packs physical page-turning buttons, which feel more intuitive to use than tapping either side of the display as you have to do on Amazon’s modern e-readers. The speedy e-reader also supports more file formats, including EPUB files, and makes it much easier to borrow books from the Overdrive library system. Native support for Pocket, meanwhile, means you can read your articles offline if you’re someone who uses the long-standing bookmarking app.\nHowever, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required for performing certain tasks. That gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more often than the Libra Colour. The Kobo can’t easily tap into Amazon’s vast library of ebooks, which can be frustrating if you’ve amassed a collection of Kindle titles over the years. It can be done, but you have to convert file formats using third-party apps, which is tricky and can take time.\nBut if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Kobo Libra Colour will give you the best digital reading experience of all the e-readers on our list. It’s my personal favorite.\nRead our Kobo Libra Colour review.\nThe best cheap ebook reader\nDimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / Weight: 158 grams / Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support \nThe base-model Kindle ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging. \nReading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the Amazon Kindle Kids Edition which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also comes with six months of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime).\nThe base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing you’ll find in the entry-level Kobo Clara BW and Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on Barnes & Noble’s entry-level e-reader, the Nook GlowLight 4e (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110.\nThe best ebook reader for taking notes\nDimensions: 7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / Weight: 390 grams / Screen area and resolution: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support \nOf all the large ebook readers I tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as on a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural.\nThe Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document as opposed to on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a trade-off I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes.\nFinally, the Kobo Elipsa 2E comes with twice the storage (32GB) for the same price as the base Kindle Scribe. You can step up to the 32GB Kindle Scribe for $20 more or upgrade to 64GB for $40 extra. Yet given the Scribe’s limitations, I still recommend saving the money and buying the Kobo Elipsa 2E instead.\nNote-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading.  That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3, which lets you insert links to notes — lacks.\nOther ebook readers that didn’t make the cut\nThere are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable:\nKindle Colorsoft Signature Edition\nThe Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. Amazon doesn’t offer a cheaper version of the Colorsoft like it does with the Paperwhite, which is available in standard and Signature Edition versions, but if you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft is your best option. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter \nKobo Clara Colour\nIf you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, the Kobo Clara Colour — the successor to the Kobo Clara 2E — is worth a look. At $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than the Kobo Clara 2E, but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. Plus, it’s noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point.\nBoox Palma 2\nDespite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. The Boox Palma 2 is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the $279.99 Palma 2 also runs Android 13 so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter \nBoox Go 10.3\nThe $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus.\nHowever, in comparison to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and comes with a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look.\nNook Glowlight 4 Plus\nIn 2023, Barnes and Noble released the Nook Glowlight 4 Plus. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The $199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plus is a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book.\nWhat’s coming next\nBoox recently introduced two new e-readers: the Boox Go 7 and the Go Color 7 Gen II, which retail for $249.99 and $279.99, respectively. Both devices are water-resistant, support note-taking, and feature 300ppi resolution — though the Go Color 7 Gen II drops to 150ppi when displaying color content. Like other Boox devices, they also run on Android, giving you access to a wide range of apps and online bookstores through the Google Play Store. A stylus isn’t included, so you’ll need to spend an extra $45.99 for Boox’s pressure-sensitive InkSense pen if you want to take notes.\nUpdate, June 12th: Adjusted pricing / availability.
