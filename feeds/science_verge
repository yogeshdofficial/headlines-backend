The Information reports that Amazon is developing AI software that will enable robots to operate as package delivery workers that are ferried around in Rivian electric vans, and will soon be ready to start real-world testing at a new facility.\nCiting an anonymous source “involved in the effort,” The Information says that Amazon has almost finished constructing an indoor “humanoid park” at one of the retail giant’s San Francisco offices that’s roughly the size of a coffee shop. The obstacle course reportedly contains one Rivian van for training purposes, with Amazon aiming to have humanoid robots “hitch a ride in the back of Amazon’s electric Rivian vans and spring out to deliver packages.”\nThe report coincides with Amazon launching a new agentic AI team to help develop technologies that will power robots “operating in Amazon distribution and logistics hubs.” In a statement to Silicon Valley, Amazon says that “instead of rigid, specialized robots, we’re creating systems that can hear, understand, and act on natural language commands, turning warehouse robots into flexible, multi-talented assistants.”\nAmazon is already using a variety of autonomous robots in its warehouse operations, including a trial of Agility Robotics’ humanoid “Digit” — a robot that was originally pitched for tasks like sitting in the back of vans and delivering packages, alongside other logistics uses. Amazon’s training facility is a concerted effort to make this original vision a reality. The Information reports that a “variety” of humanoid robots will be tested for package delivery at its facility, including a $16,000 unit from China-based Unitree.\nHundreds of thousands of people currently handle delivery operations at Amazon globally. Amazon acquired the robotaxi company Zoox in 2020, suggesting a desire to fully automate end-to-end package delivery, from the warehouse to your front door.","summary":"Future Amazon orders may be delivered to your door by a humanoid robot workforce.

While he was at DOGE, he literally could control the Treasury and DOD - he effectively had the IT reins of the entire country, and could simply gut things he hated at will. There was a price for that: it destroyed what was left of his reputation. But it was real, true power - being able to stop payments at will makes you more powerful than the president.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So much for that. These days, Musk is <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930336497208832059\">reduced to begging his followers on X</a> to call their senators and congressmen [sic, obviously] to vote down the Big Beautiful Bill. His nominal reason is that Donald Trump's budget plan will increase the deficit, but reports indicate that Musk is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/04/musk-trump-tax-bill.html\">annoyed an EV credit is getting cut</a>. That makes it harder to sell Teslas in an environment where it's already hard to sell Teslas.
