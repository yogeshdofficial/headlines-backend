It’s coming to Xbox, PS5, and PC, and will be available for Game Pass subscribers.\nWhile it was just announced, the remake has seemed like a foregone conclusion for some time — and not just because several voice actors leaked its existence. Persona 3 received a similar remake last year with Persona 3 Reload, which was very well received, and in 2023 both Persona 3 and Persona 4 were re-released on modern platforms, introducing them to new audiences.\nPersona 4 — which added a murder mystery element to the long-running RPG series — was originally released on the PlayStation 2 in 2008, though it received a major boost with the enhanced PS Vita version Persona 4 Golden three years later.\nAs for the next mainline entry in the franchise, Atlus wrote in a statement that “we are actively preparing for the future development of the Persona series as a studio.” So maybe we’ll finally hear about Persona 6 sometime soon.","summary":"The worst-kept secret in gaming is no longer a secret.
