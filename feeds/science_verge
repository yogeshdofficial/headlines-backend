Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-apple-watch-se-deals\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#zdhvKu\">The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#MpVWgd\">A note on the more premium models</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But with all of those options, which one should you pick?

Fortunately, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/679225/apple-watchos-26-wwdc-features\">next iteration of watchOS</a> will continue to support the same devices when it arrives in the fall, even if Apple is revamping its naming convention in a bid to standardize its operating system names.</p>\n\n<p>All that being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s get to the deals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25623065/247270_Apple_watch_series_10_AKrales_0370.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Person looking at music widget on Apple Watch Series 10\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7/\"> <strike>$399</strike> $299 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11385157008\"> <strike>$399</strike> $299 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-series-10-gps-42mm-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band-s-m-jet-black-2024/6572678.p\"> <strike>$399</strike> $299 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div><div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Apple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25622995/247270_Apple_watch_series_10_AKrales_0090.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHQ2QH6/\"> <strike>$429</strike> $329 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11381354322\"> <strike>$429</strike> $329 at <strong>Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-series-10-gps-46mm-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band-s-m-jet-black-2024/6572688.p\"> <strike>$429</strike> $329 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind. Fortunately, the next iteration of watchOS will continue to support the same devices when it arrives in the fall, even if Apple is revamping its naming convention in a bid to standardize its operating system names.\nAll that being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $299 at Amazon\n $399 $299 at Walmart\n $399 $299 at Best Buy\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 $329 at Amazon\n $429 $329 at Walmart\n $429 $329 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($100 off), which is just $20 shy of its recent Prime Day low. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $329 (also $100 off) — which is the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at around $399 ($100 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $169 at Amazon\n $249 $169 at Walmart\n $249 $169 at Best Buy\n\n\n2022 Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $199 at Amazon\n $279 $199 at Walmart\n $279 $199 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, 9, and 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity increases the starting price to $299 for the 40mm size (the 44mm size adds $20 to each configuration).\nRight now, the best deal on the latest SE can be found at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can pick up the 40mm model with GPS starting at $169 ($80 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available from the same retailers (Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy) starting at $199 ($80 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 40mm model is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $219 (also $80 off), which is about $20 shy of the best price we’ve seen on the entry-level LTE configuration.\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nApple Watch Ultra 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799 $649 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop)\n $799 $649.99 at Amazon (with Trail Loop)\n $799 $649.99 at Amazon (with Ocean Band)\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\nThanks to Amazon Prime Day, we recently saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to its lowest price to date in select configurations.

Matter</em></p>\n\n<p>Roborock’s <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra\">S8 MaxV Ultra</a> ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed.</p>\n\n<p>The S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22960447/roborock-s7-maxv-ultra-review-robot-vacuum-mop-hybrid\">S7 MaxV Ultra</a> and has been steadily improving it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25406962/247088_Roborock_vs_DreameBot_JTuohy_0010.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 MaxV Ultra brings back the RGB camera last seen on the S7 MaxV Ultra, which makes it much better at navigating obstacles.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>That&#8217;s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest.</p>\n\n<p>For $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-with-refill-drainage-system\">Refill &amp; Drainage System</a> model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">SwitchBot S10</a> with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25405367/247088_Roborock_vs_DreameBot_JTuohy_0008.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The S8 MaxV Ultra uses two small appendages to better get into corners and clean along edges.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up.</p>\n\n<p>Roborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. </p>\n\n<p>It also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. </p>\n\n<p>Its sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners.</p>\n\n<p>Roborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” </p>\n\n<p>Roborock also sells the <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-max-ultra\">S8 Max Ultra</a> (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV.</p>\n\n<p>There are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"VGFl7c\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24141479/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-vs-dreame-x30-ultra-robot-vacuum-mop\">Read my Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum\">Best budget robot vacuum</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Tapo RV30 Max Plus</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/8A0A2480.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A black robot vacuum on a hardwood floor\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Cheap, even with the auto-empty dock </li><li>A dual mop and dustbin means no swapping</li><li>Room-specific cleaning</li><li>Carpet boost</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Short battery life</li><li>Slow to recharge</li><li>Docking can be spotty</li><li>Basic obstacle detection</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://us.store.tp-link.com/products/tapo-rv30-max-plus-5300pa-suction-robot-vacuum-mop-with-auto-empty-dock\"> <strike>$299.99</strike> $219.99 at <strong>TP-Link (with code 30RVWEEKLY)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGRJKDKC/\"> <strike>$299.99</strike> $229.99 at <strong>Amazon (with code 20TAPOVCM)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><em><strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>300ml<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Auto-refill mop option: </strong>No<strong> / Mop lift: </strong>No <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mop washing</strong>: No <strong>/  Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ <strong>AI-powered obstacle detection: </strong>No / <strong>Suction power:</strong> 5,300Pa<strong> / <em><em><strong>Remote check-in:</strong> </em></em></strong><em><em>No</em></em><em><em> </em></em></em>/</em> <em><em><strong>Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual / <strong>Brush style: </strong>Single rubber bristle hybrid<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you&#8217;re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8A0A2475.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.3333333333333,100,83.333333333333\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Tapo RV30 Max Plus includes a compact auto-empty charging dock.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup.

Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks.</p>\n\n<p>The Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25350586/8A0A1093.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Its charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Its charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>In fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25350587/8A0A1090.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Narwal can use disposal dustbins that compress dirt, so you don’t have to empty it as often.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Narwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test.</p>\n\n<p>The app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-robot-vacuum-mop-hybrid\">Best robot vacuum / mop hybrid</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Dreame X40 Ultra</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25509055/IMG_3249.JPG?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Self-removing mop pads </li><li>Mop extension reaches under edges</li><li>Self-cleaning washboard</li><li>Dirt detection tech</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Middling AI obstacle detection </li><li>Single rubber roller brush</li><li>App can be flaky</li><li></li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0CXDXKSXP/\"> <strike>$1499.99</strike> $899.99 at <strong>Amazon (Prime members)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>300ml<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Auto-refill mop option: </strong>Yes<strong> / Mop-lift: </strong>Yes, 20mm <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mop washing</strong>: Hot water, hot air drying <strong>/  Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ <strong>AI-powered obstacle detection: </strong>Yes / <strong>Suction power:</strong> 12,000Pa <strong>/ Remote check-in:</strong> Yes<strong> / Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual / <strong>Brush style: </strong>Single, rubber<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts </em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive.</p>\n\n<p>The X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25354791/trim.C53A9FD9_159B_4AED_918B_FA75A3CBEC00.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Dreame X30 Ultra shows its splits.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Its signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius.</p>\n\n<p>While it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignleft\"><blockquote><p>If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>Roborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features.</p>\n\n<p>The X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer.</p>\n\n<p>The X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cxWX29\">Best midrange robot vacuum / mop </h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Eufy X10 Pro Omni</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25349902/8A0A1063.jpeg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Good AI-powered obstacle detection</li><li>Effective mopping</li><li>Excellent value</li><li>Nice dock</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Single rubber / bristle brush</li><li>Lower suction power </li><li>No heated mop washing</li><li>Some navigation issues</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPFBBHP4/\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.eufy.com/products/t2351121?variant=44613959090362\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Eufy (with code WS24T2351)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/eufy-x10-pro-omni-wi-fi-connected-robot-vacuum-mop-with-self-washing-and-self-drying-auto-empty-station-black/6576392.p\"> <strike>$799.99</strike> $699.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>Unknown<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Auto-refill mop option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/<strong> Mop lift: </strong>Yes, 12mm <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mop washing</strong>: Yes, hot air drying <strong>/  Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ <strong>AI-powered obstacle detection: </strong>Yes / <strong>Suction power: </strong>8,000Pa / <strong>Remote check-in</strong>: No / <strong>Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Brush style: </strong>Single rubber / bristle hybrid<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home </em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the <a href=\"https://howl.me/clYvySdBoeH\">Eufy X8 Pro</a> self-empty robot vacuum.

Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.)</p>\n\n<p>An edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25354855/8A0A1070__1_.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Eufy uses a single rubber / bristle roller brush that isn’t as good as top-of-the-line Roombas and Roborocks.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.</p>\n\n<p>While its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn&#8217;t effective.</p>\n\n<p>The Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try.

Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. </p>\n\n<p><span>The newest model, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Combo-Vacuum-AutoWash/dp/B0D9ZRH61T\" target=\"_blank\">Combo 10 Max</a>, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line</span>, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). </p>\n\n<p>While its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23489768/irobot-roomba-combo-j7-plus-robot-vacuum-mop-review\">retractable mopping system</a> is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8A0A2623.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Combo has a redesigned dock that’s very large — to accommodate two water tanks and a dust bag — but it doubles as a table.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The <a href=\"https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba-combo-j9plus-auto-fill-robot-vacuum-and-mop/C975020.html\">j9 Combo Plus</a> has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>The Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. </p>\n\n<p>iRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/8A0A2036.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The mopping pad is barely there.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>While its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use <a href=\"https://www.automate.org/vision/blogs/what-is-visual-slam-technology-and-what-is-it-used-for\">vSLAM</a>, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted.</p>\n\n<p>I really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Roomba-Self-Emptying-Robot-Vacuum/dp/B0C415NHBM\">Roomba j9 Plus</a>.

Over the last few years, they have gone from being utilitarian devices that sweep your floor to full-fledged home robots that can vacuum and mop your home and then trundle off to clean themselves to be ready for the next run. \nI’ve been testing robot vacuums for seven years and have run over 70 robot vacuums all over my house. These are my top picks if you’re looking for the best: a robot vacuum that can do it all with limited intervention from you.\nAlong with my top picks, I have options to fit specific needs, such as mopping or besting pet hair. The good news is that there are a lot of great options. Whether you have a 3,000-square-foot home and three shaggy dogs or a small, stylish apartment you share with a goldfish, there’s a robot vacuum to suit your needs. \nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWith top-notch vacuuming performance, an easy-to-use app, and built-in voice control, the S8 MaxV Ultra is a superb vacuum and good mop.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Amazon\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Roborock\n\nBest budget option: Tapo RV30 Max Plus\nTap’s RV30 Max Plus is a robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $219.99 at TP-Link (with code 30RVWEEKLY)\n $299.99 $229.99 at Amazon (with code 20TAPOVCM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest robot vacuum\nBest budget robot vacuum\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop \nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nOther robot vacuums to consider\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\n\nBest robot vacuum\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent vacuuming performance\nGood sonic mopping\nExtendable side brush gets into corners better\nVery good app\n\nDock is still quite ugly\nMopping tray is hard to clean\nExpensive\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Amazon \n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $1299.99 at Roborock\n\nDustbin capacity: 270ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water and heated air drying / Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 10,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via Matter\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra ($1,799.99) is an exceptional vacuum cleaner and a very good mop. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 10,000Pa suction make it great on carpets; its sonic mopping is very good on hard floors, and its improved AI-powered obstacle detection means it will most likely get the job done without getting trapped or derailed.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra is the best in the category of “hands-free” robot vacs, bots that do virtually everything for you: empty their bins, refill their mop tanks, and clean and dry their mop pads. Roborock invented this category with the S7 MaxV Ultra and has been steadily improving it.\nThat’s the big selling point here; this bot is basically hands-free. Fill the S8 MaxV Ultra’s clean water tank and empty its dirty water once a week and change out the dust bag every couple of months. The robot will take care of the rest.\nFor $100 more, you can dispense with dealing with the water tanks entirely and buy the Refill & Drainage System model. This lets you plumb the charging base directly into your home’s water supply. I’ve not tested this on the Roborock, but my experience with the SwitchBot S10 with the same feature leads me to recommend this option if you can swing it.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra comes with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, bringing back the camera it last had on the S7 MaxV Ultra. It’s not quite as good as Roomba’s obstacle detection — it sometimes confused a pile of Cheerios for a charging cable and avoided them — but it’s much better than the Roborocks that rely on non-camera obstacle detection. It deftly navigates around most household clutter, allowing you to get the job done without having to tidy up.\nRoborock has caught up to Roomba on cleaning prowess, and the S8 MaxV Ultra’s dual rubber brushes and 10,000Pa of suction power tackled the pet hair on my fluffy carpet and demolished my oatmeal test. \nIt also did a better job at mopping than Roomba’s mopping bots, though not quite as well as the Narwal Freo X Ultra or Dreame X40 Ultra, though it’s a better vacuum than either. \nIts sonic mopping system — which vibrates its mop pad 4,000 times a minute — ably simulated scrubbing and wiped out my OJ and ketchup tests, though I did have to set it to deep scrub. Plus, the addition of a side mop and flexi-arm brush that extends from the bot helped with cleaning edges and corners.\nRoborock’s mobile app is easy to use and comes with a laundry list of features and customizations that give you ample control over your cleaning. The S8 MaxV Ultra also has a built-in voice assistant, which makes getting the bot to clean the mess your kid made after dinner as easy as saying, “Rocky, clean here.” \nRoborock also sells the S8 Max Ultra (no V) for $1,599.99. It has the same cleaning hardware as the MaxV but no camera, so its obstacle detection will not be as good. However, you also don’t have to worry about a camera in your house. It has a lower 8,000Pa of suction and lacks a voice assistant, too, which makes it seem overpriced since it’s currently only a couple hundred dollars less than the MaxV.\nThere are several great vacuum / mop hybrids in this guide. Of them, the S8 MaxV Ultra is the best at vacuuming and obstacle detection, and it’s a very good mop. It can also do both in one run, as it can lift its mop 20mm, which will clear all but the highest-pile rugs. If you have a lot of those, go for the Dreame X40, with its automatic mop removal. Its vacuuming and object detection are a notch below the Roborock’s, but its mopping is a notch above. The Narwal Freo X Ultra is an even better mop than the Dreame, but its obstacle detection isn’t great, and its vacuuming is merely pretty good.\nRead my Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra review.\nBest budget robot vacuum\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nCheap, even with the auto-empty dock \nA dual mop and dustbin means no swapping\nRoom-specific cleaning\nCarpet boost\n\nShort battery life\nSlow to recharge\nDocking can be spotty\nBasic obstacle detection\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $219.99 at TP-Link (with code 30RVWEEKLY)\n $299.99 $229.99 at Amazon (with code 20TAPOVCM)\n\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: No / Mop lift: No / Mop washing: No /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: No / Suction power: 5,300Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nFor around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.\nThanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. \nIts 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it had generally picked up all visible debris.\nMopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water to do a good surface clean.\nAnother unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as the three rotations.\n\n5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price\n\n\nThe Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can even set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.\nIt’s also super easy to start a clean, and I really like that you can just tap on the map to send the robot to that spot. The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally had trouble repositioning itself on its dock. You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.\nBest mopping robot vacuum for hard floors\nNarwal Freo X Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nThe best mopping robot\nAlso good at vacuuming\nVery quiet\nBig water tanks mean less refilling\n\nMiddling laser-based obstacle avoidance\nWonky app\nHuge charging dock\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $899.99 $699.99 at Costco (with Accessory Pack Bundle)\n $899.99 $699.99 at Narwal\n\nDustbin capacity: 1L / Self-empty dock option: No / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,200Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, conical rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra is one of the best mopping robots I’ve tested — and it’s a good vacuum, too. Its spinning triangular mop pads rotate at 180RPM with 12n of downward pressure. Combined with its ability to swing slightly to get closer to baseboards, the Narwal does a very good job on hard floors. Its dual four-liter water tanks will keep you going longer than most other mopping bots as well, the majority of which feature smaller tanks.\nThe Narwal has some innovative features, including dirt sense — which analyzes the dirt level in the water and prompts it to remop — and an ability to adapt the pressure of its mop based on the type of floor, applying more pressure to tile and less to hardwood. “Freo” refers to the bot’s ability to make cleaning “decisions,” including going back to clean dirty floors.\nIts charging dock is very big, though, giving off a real Wall-E vibe. But despite the size, there’s no spot for an auto-empty dustbin; instead, Narwal’s disposable onboard bin compresses the dust, and Narwal claims you won’t need to empty it for up to 60 days. It wasn’t close to full after two weeks of testing. A bonus here is that there’s no loud noise, as is the case with most auto-empty docks.\n\nIts charging dock is very big, giving off a real Wall-E vibe\n\n\nIn fact, the Freo X Ultra is one of the quietest bots I’ve tested. Even at full power, it was so quiet that I had to check that it was working. Its anti-tangle brush and 8,200Pa suction did a good job on most carpet, but its 12mm mop lifting isn’t good for plush carpets.\nNarwal’s obstacle detection is also only okay; there’s no camera, and it routinely eats cables. Its three lasers can identify objects as small as a sock and move around them, and it did pass my fake pet poop test.\nThe app is very hard to follow, making it tricky to access all of the bot’s features. Mapping was fast, but it didn’t recognize all my rooms on the first go. It did better the second time, although splitting up rooms and naming them in the app was painful. The lack of a camera also means its navigation is spotty, and sending it to clean specific rooms wasn’t always successful. But if you’ve got a lot of hard floors to keep clean, it will do an excellent job.\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid\nDreame X40 Ultra\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSelf-removing mop pads \nMop extension reaches under edges\nSelf-cleaning washboard\nDirt detection tech\n\nMiddling AI obstacle detection \nSingle rubber roller brush\nApp can be flaky\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $899.99 at Amazon (Prime members)\n\nDustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop-lift: Yes, 20mm / Mop washing: Hot water, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 12,000Pa / Remote check-in: Yes / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts \nThe Dreame X40 is the best robot vacuum / mop hybrid because it can drop its mop pads automatically, extend them, and swing them to get under your cabinets and consoles. I watched the X40 spread its mops wide apart and swing behind my TV console, allowing it to access the dust wedged a good inch under it. That’s impressive.\nThe X40 also features an extending side brush arm to reach corners — like the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra — and its dual oscillating mop pads are more effective than Roborock’s thin microfiber pad. If you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you.\nIts signature feature is its ability to automatically remove and reattach its mop pads, depending on whether it’s vacuuming or mopping. This solves the problem of how to vacuum and mop without getting your rugs wet. The robot will do this procedure multiple times during cleaning to ensure carpets are vacuumed and floors are mopped. Genius.\nWhile it’s a superb mopper, its vacuuming prowess is slightly behind the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra because, despite its 12,000Pa suction power, it still only has a single roller rubber brush. The Roborock’s dual rollers are simply better at getting dirt out of carpets and tackling pet hair.\n\nIf you have a mix of carpeted rooms and hardwood floors with high-pile rugs, the Dreame is the best robot vacuum for you\n\n\nRoborock’s app is also more stable and easier to use than Dreame’s, which often crashes and can take a while to load. While the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is my top pick overall, the Dreame X40 is a very good vacuum, and the two companies are neck and neck regarding innovative features.\nThe X40 can also clean its washboard, something the Roborock can’t. That area can get quite grungy, so it needs a cleaning every few weeks. The X40 has AI-powered smart dirt detection that uses its cameras to identify spills like milk or particularly dirty areas. When it spots something, it will slow down and do a more thorough cleaning. I also like Dreame’s option to vacuum first and then mop, which the Roborock doesn’t offer.\nThe X40 has AI-powered obstacle detection, although Roborock’s is just a bit better. However, both still get tripped up occasionally by pencils and other small items — something that never happens with the Roombas with this feature.\nBest midrange robot vacuum / mop \nEufy X10 Pro Omni\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood AI-powered obstacle detection\nEffective mopping\nExcellent value\nNice dock\n\nSingle rubber / bristle brush\nLower suction power \nNo heated mop washing\nSome navigation issues\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $699.99 at Amazon\n $799.99 $699.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n $799.99 $699.99 at Best Buy\n\nDustbin capacity: Unknown / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, 12mm / Mop washing: Yes, hot air drying /  Mapping: Yes, lidar / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: 8,000Pa / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Single rubber / bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home \nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni combines the Eufy Clean X9 Pro mopping robot vacuum and the Eufy X8 Pro self-empty robot vacuum. It’s the first Eufy with a multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock, and unlike many bots in this price range, it comes with AI-powered obstacle detection.\nWith 8,000Pa suction and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping, the X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them. Which is sort of the definition of “midrange.”\n\n The X10 has all the same functions as the top-of-the-line, all-in-one bots — but it’s not quite as good at any of them\n\n\nThe Eufy performed excellently in my mopping tests, even eradicating dried stains with its 1kg of downward pressure. Thanks to an onboard water reservoir, it didn’t have to head home to fill up as frequently as some mopping bots do. It also has heated mop drying to help prevent the base from getting stinky — a first in this price range. (There’s no hot water washing.)\nAn edge-hugging mode makes the robot swing its behind into the baseboards to help mop edges. With its square-ish shape, it got into corners better than most of the round bots. But its 12mm mop pad lift over carpet wasn’t effective, resulting in its pads getting hung up in a few places.\nThe X10 has great object recognition, allowing it to suck up Cheerios and piles of oatmeal while deftly navigating fake dog turds and cables. However, its navigation sometimes got screwy; it would go into a corner and stay there for a while, trying to figure itself out.\nWhile its vacuuming is good, particularly on carpet and tile surfaces, the single rubber / bristle roller brush lets it down and is a good illustration of my point that it’s not all about suction power; it’s also about the brushes and how you use them. The Eufy’s brush is supposedly anti-tangle — a cutting tool inside the robot should shred the hair — but this wasn’t effective.\nThe Eufy Clean app is very easy to use, and the lidar-powered mapping was fast and accurate, dividing my rooms correctly on the first try. There are many customization options — including room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and customized cleaning — but the app is clear and well laid out.\nBest robot vacuum for pet hair\nRoomba Combo 10 Max\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent vacuuming\nSuperior AI obstacle detection\nSmart scrub feature works well\nAttractive dock that doubles as a table\n\nSmall mop pad\nLimited cleaning customization\nMapping can take a long time\nNavigation can be buggy\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1399.99 $599.99 at Amazon\n $1399.99 $1199.99 at iRobot\n\nDustbin capacity: 250 ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Auto-refill mop option: Yes / Mop lift: Yes, up and over / Mop washing: Yes / Mapping: Yes, vSLAM / AI-powered obstacle detection: Yes / Suction power: N/A / Remote check-in: No / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Brush style: Dual rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts, Apple Home via the Matter protocol.\nWhile Roombas may have fallen behind the competition in terms of features and innovation, there’s one area in which they reign supreme, and that’s cleaning prowess. Their dual rubber roller brushes rotate in opposite directions to effectively dig up dirt from carpets, and they are by far the best at tackling pet hair on all surfaces. They are also one of the most self-repairable robot vacuums you can buy, with spare parts for most of the bot’s bits readily available. \nThe newest model, the Combo 10 Max, is the best Roomba for pet hair as it ties for the highest suction power of the current Roomba line, plus it can clean its own mop. It also has top-notch AI-powered obstacle detection that is able to tell the difference between pet poop and a pile of popcorn (and vacuum up one while avoiding the other). \nWhile its mopping isn’t great — the pad is tiny, and there’s no swinging to get along baseboards — it does a decent job, and its retractable mopping system is handy if you have a lot of carpets. All of this makes the Combo 10 Max a great buy for pet parents who are in a daily battle with shedding and occasional muddy paw prints. \nThe Combo is the first Roomba with a multifunction dock that can refill its mopping tank and self-wash its mopping pad, meaning less hands-on time for you. (The j9 Combo Plus has the same suction power and can refill its mopping tank but can’t wash the mop pad.) The SmartScrub feature that tells the robot to wiggle its butt to scrub your floors works surprisingly well, but it’s really only effective on small areas, making it good to run in hallways and around pet bowls for an extra clean. \n\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, actively seeking out spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out\n\n\nThe Dirt Detect feature remembers the dirtiest rooms, and I found that meant it actively seeks out the spots my hairy Wirehaired Pointing Griffon hangs out. The 10 Max can also be set to mop only, which is a new option and is handy for deep cleans. But there’s no hot water washing or hot air drying of the mop as there is on similar Dreame and Roborock models, so you’ll want to throw the pad in the washing machine every now and then. \niRobot’s app is also a bit of a pain point. While I appreciate its simplicity, I miss the deeper cleaning customization options that most other high-end robot vacuum apps offer. And it’s recently started popping up ads for Roomba products when I navigate between screens — which is one of the features I did not want to see migrate over from the competition.\nWhile its mapping is very good, it can take a really long time (Roombas use vSLAM, not lidar), and it doesn’t seem to adapt to changes in my home as easily as other robots. (It also doesn’t lose my maps as often as other robots.) I’ve also noticed that the newer Roombas (j9 and 10 Max) suffer from the occasional navigation glitches, occasionally getting confused and needing to be rebooted.\nI really like Roomba’s dock design, which, while large enough to accommodate two rather small water tanks, is the most stylish of all the multifunction docks. Plus, because you access the water tanks from the front rather than the top (as on most other models), it can be used as a table. That’s a small quality-of-life upgrade I enjoy. \nOverall, it’s a good-looking robot that vacuums really well and is smart enough to get the job done with limited intervention. If you’re not interested in mopping at all, however, save some money and get the Roomba j9 Plus. It has similar cleaning prowess, a self-empty dock, and no messing with mopping.\nOther robot vacuums to consider\nThe 360 Vis Nav ($699.99 $999.99), Dyson’s first robovac in the US in almost a decade, is a powerful beast and the best robot vacuum for carpets I’ve tested. But its navigation needs a lot of work. If you have a simple floor plan with a lot of carpets, it is worth considering, but the short battery life and lack of an auto-empty dock are major cons. Read more in this hands-on.\nThe Roomba j7 ($599.99) is a previous top pick that has great AI-powered obstacle detection, excellent navigation skills, and superior cleaning power. It can be a bit rough with furniture, but it is aggressive at getting your floors clean and is a great vacuum-only Roomba.\nThe Dreame X30 Ultra ($619.99 with code DMX30U08 $899.99) is the older version of my top pick for a vacuum / mop hybrid and is a great buy if you can get it on sale. It does most everything the X40 Ultra does, just with lower suction power (8,3000Pa) and no flexi-arm.\nThe Roborock Q8 Max Plus ($379.99 $659.99) is the bigger brother to the Q5 Pro (my pick for pet hair in my budget robot vacuum guide), adding better obstacle detection (still no camera) and better mopping. However, it has a smaller bin to make way for a much bigger water reservoir for mopping (350ml). If you like the idea of the Q5 Pro but want better mopping, this is a good option.\nThe Roborock S8 Plus ($499.99 $629.99) is a great vacuum that can mop well, has good obstacle detection, and has a sleeker, smaller charging / auto-empty dock with no water tank. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do a good job, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors.\nThe Roborock S8 Pro Ultra (which is currently out of stock but normally retails for $549.99) is similar to the S8 MaxV but ditches the camera, so it’s less effective at dodging obstacles than the S8 MaxV. Get this if you don’t want a camera on your robot and don’t mind not having Matter support or a built-in voice assistant.\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 ($399.99 $699.99) was my previous runner-up pick for a midrange option that self-empties its bin, vacuums, and mops. It mops very well, but you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin.\nWhat I’m testing and what’s coming next\nRoborock’s Saros 10 ($1,599.99) and 10R ($1,599.99) are upgrades to the S8 MaxV Ultra. Both can automatically remove their mop pads when not needed — a new option for Roborock — and feature an AdaptLift chassis to climb high room transitions. The 10R features 19,000Pa suction power, StarSight 2.0 navigation, and oscillating mops. The Saros 10 has 22,000Pa of suction power, lidar navigation, and the vibrating flat mopping pad of the S8 MaxV.\nRoborock also recently released the Saros Z70 ($2,599), which is the first mass-produced robovac to feature a robotic arm that can pick up objects like socks and tissues. The arm itself isn’t particularly reliable, but the Z70 still functions as an excellent robot vacuum with 22,000Pa suction power, support for Roborock’s StarSight navigation system, and an AdaptLift chassis. Read our review.\nIn March, iRobot announced a new Roomba lineup that starts at $299 and goes up to $999. All of the robovacs come with lidar navigation and mapping, 7,000Pa suction power, and four suction levels. The pricier 405 and 505 models are the first Roombas to feature dual spinning mopping pads, while the 505 also offers heated mop drying, which is something even the higher-end Combo 10 Max lacks.\nIn April, iRobot also introduced the Roomba Max 705 ($679.99 $899.99), which comes with an auto-empty dock. The Matter-compatible robovac brings back iRobot’s dual rubber roller brushes, which, based on our previous testing, do an excellent job of picking up pet hair; the 705 also features AI-powered obstacle detection, lidar navigation, and 13,000Pa of suction — the most of any Roomba to date.\nLast month, iRobot announced the Roomba Max 705 Combo, an upgraded version of the Roomba Max 705. The step-up model comes with a new self-deploying mop cover to protect carpets from getting wet, along with an extendable mop that cleans corners and wall edges for a more thorough clean. It’ll be available for preorder in the US “later this year” for around $1,272 (€1099). \nThe new Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni E28 ($999.99) is a self-emptying, self-refilling, and self-washing robot vacuum / mop hybrid. The vac comes with a deep cleaner integrated into the charging dock, which you can use to spray clean water on stains before sucking everything into a separate wastewater tank. It’s also powerful, boasting up to 20,000Pa of suction power, and offers AI-powered obstacle detection and Matter support.\nThe Dreame X50 Ultra ($1,199.99 $1,699.99) adds a “motorized swing arm” that acts like a leg, allowing the robovac to climb a transition up to 6cm tall. Otherwise, it’s a lot like the X40 Ultra, only with higher suction power.\nThe Ecovacs Deebot X8 Pro Omni ($969.99 $1,399.99) is the first Deebot with a roller mop. It features an extendable mop that can clean itself, boasts 18,000Pa of suction power, and comes with a redesigned auto-empty fill dock.\nThe Switchbot K10 Plus Pro Combo ($379.99 399.99) is an upgrade to the compact K10 Plus, a previous pick for the best robot vacuum for small spaces. It has better obstacle detection and a bump up to 3,000Pa of suction power. Plus, its auto-empty dock incorporates a manual stick vacuum.\nThe Switchbot S20 robot vacuum / mop hybrid ($799.99), which looks like the Switchbot S20 Pro announced at CES, launched in early August. It features an extendable roller mop and side brush, as well as 15,000Pa of suction power, which is more than twice that of our previous pick for the best mopping vacuum (the last-gen S10).\nSharkNinja’s PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum / mop ($699.99 $999.99) can lift itself over rugs by up to 20mm. Uniquely, its automatic empty /wash / dry cleaning station doesn’t require bags.\nRoborock’s Qrevo Curv ($1,399.99 $1,599.99) can raise itself to clear thresholds up to 40mm. The svelte-looking bot gets its name from a curved FlexiArm Arc side brush, which helps prevent hair from tangling as much.\nNarwal’s Freo Z Ultra ($949.99 with on-page coupon $1,499.99) is an upgrade to my current pick for the best mopping bot. It features dual cameras and dual AI chips for seeing and identifying objects, which should help with obstacle detection and vacuuming methods.\nThe Eufy S1 Pro ($999.99 with on-page coupon $1,499.99) has a long roller mop that self-cleans as it mops and features a square-ish design that allows it to get into corners more easily. A single rubber roller brush, 8,000Pa of suction, and 3D-powered obstacle detection tackle the vacuuming.\nThe Matic is a $1,095 robot vacuum that doesn’t need a cloud connection and uses cameras to navigate. It’s also the first robovac mop I’ve seen that can suck up wet spills as well as dry ones. Here’s some video of it in action.\nPhotos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\nUpdate, August 4th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of the forthcoming Roomba Max 705 Combo.

To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review\">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and it didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I tried several types of cases on the Switch 2. I tested flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for slim zip-up/clasp cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or both, ideally.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the <strong>Dbrand Killswitch</strong> is the best model overall. I published a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/686719/dbrand-killswitch-switch-2-case-review\">full review of the Killswitch</a>, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-best-switch-2-case-for-both-handheld-and-docked-play\">The best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Dbrand Killswitch &#8211; Switch 2</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/switch2dbranddocked.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Very secure fit</li><li>Makes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)</li><li>Clever dock adapter</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Chunky dock adapter</li><li>Not the most affordable case</li><li>Front protection only comes in the $80 tier</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases\"> $59.99 at <strong>Dbrand</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The least expensive Killswitch tier <a href=\"https://dbrand.com/shop/killswitch/nintendo-switch-2-cases\">costs $59.95</a> and includes a rear cover for the console and a small piece to adhere to its kickstand for a matching style, plus Joy-Con 2 grips, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes a skin for your hardware. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, the Switch 2 console case makes it impossible to fit into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into it, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.</p>\n\n<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"image-slider\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/switch2dbrand.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.0062539086929334,100,99.987492182614\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/dbranddock.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/dbrandJoyCon2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.8910256410256,100,86.217948717949\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/killswitch2port.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/killswitch2pull.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.0063540475282764,100,99.987291904943\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When this post originally went live, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. Basically, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/704767/dbrand-switch-2-killswitch-joy-con-lock-grip-detachment-fixed\">Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips</a> to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"runner-up\">Runner-up</h3>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/attackvector.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"An image showing the Genki Attack Vector Switch 2 case, including its swappable grips.\" title=\"An image showing the Genki Attack Vector Switch 2 case, including its swappable grips.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The grips are modular and can be swapped at will.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Genki\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Genki\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Genki’s Attack Vector</strong> case is similar in some ways to the Killswitch, as it consists of three pieces: one that goes around the console, and two pieces that wrap around each of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The <a href=\"https://www.genkithings.com/products/attack-vector\">$49.99 kit</a> improves on the Killswitch with swappable modular grips that come in three sizes to let you customize how the Joy-Con 2 fits in your hand. It follows a small, medium, and large model, with the smallest adding some minor ergonomic benefits, and the largest being what large-handed folks will likely gravitate toward to make the Switch 2 comfier to hold. Its large, palm-filling grip feels as good to use as the Killswitch, but it’s a very close race and I’d be smitten to use either.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, one notable downside with the Attack Vector is that the Joy-Con 2 sleeves can be pulled off with relative ease, unlike Dbrand’s. Their fit is accurate, technically, and they won’t fall off during normal use. But they’re not as secure as I want them to be.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Also, Genki advertises that you can keep the Attack Vector on when you insert your console into the Switch 2 dock, but its launch unit doesn’t work as intended. Genki addressed complaints on forums that the case doesn’t fit the console perfectly, and the fixed model is on its way to me at the time of this update. It will ship a replacement middle piece to all who have already purchased the case, and those who buy the case going forward will receive the fixed product.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-best-slim-protective-switch-2-cases\">The best slim, protective Switch 2 cases</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>tomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/tomtocslimcase.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Nintendo-Odorless-Protective-Portable-Protection/dp/B0DT48LYLP\"> <strike>$47.99</strike> $33 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Tomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case</strong> has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it makes color schemes that look like ice cream sandwiches.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price, in case that matters to you. While Belkin’s case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is what you get in almost any zip-up case: a soft screen-protecting layer that can hold 12 Switch cartridges.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>PowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/poweraslim.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F69R7LLR\"> $19.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/powera-slim-case-for-nintendo-switch-2-dark-heather-grey/6630615\"> $19.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Power A’s slim zip-up case </strong>for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At just <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F69R7LLR\">$19.99</a> (half the cost of <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-multi/6625926.p?skuId=6625926\">Nintendo’s official carrying case</a>), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/belkincase.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Carrying-Lightweight-Protective-Essentials/dp/B0FBQBY7P7\"> $29.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.belkin.com/p/travel-case-for-nintendo-switch-2/ENA002fqCH-V1.html\"> $29.99 at <strong>Belkin</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For $10 more ($29.99), <strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/680463/belkin-nintendo-switch-2-charging-case-battery\">Belkin’s slim case</a></strong> is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Belkin sells a <a href=\"https://www.belkin.com/p/charging-case-for-nintendo-switch-2/ENA001fqSA-V1.html\">$69.99</a> version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"runners-up\">Runners-up</h3>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/jsaux.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">JSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Carrying-Compatible-Nintendo-Switch-Protective-2/dp/B0F2F38LZK?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\">$25.99 case</a></strong> slouches on other features you might want. Once it’s opened, all there is to see is a velcro strap that secures your Switch 2. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. Like the Belkin and PowerA cases, this one prevents accidental pressing on the Joy-Con 2 sticks through its shell. It’s a little too light on features to recommend broadly, and it’s thicker than the other models.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/genkisleepercase.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.genkithings.com/products/sleeper-case\">Genki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case</a></strong> is a <em>very </em>tough soft case. Its wool-wrapped shell doesn’t have nearly as much give as other slim cases. Plus, its screen guard can carry up to 18 cartridges. However, I dislike how much the Switch 2 moves around when you shake the case (the fit is snug if you have the company’s Attack Vector case equipped). Notably, Genki’s Neil Trachy, who handles marketing and media relations, shared with <em>The Verge</em> that a production error may impact how well its zipper works in the long run, and that a free fix is coming in late July for all who’ve already purchased one (the updated case is on its way to me at the time of this update for testing). The fix will be implemented for all future purchasers of the case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Our Sleeper Case was upgraded to a waterproof zipper last minute and unbeknownst to our production team, the adhesives used were not binding well to the zipper. [&#8230;] While the case is still rock solid, the weak point will be the glue that holds it all in place.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-best-form-fitting-shells-for-the-switch-2-in-handheld-mode\">The best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Killswitch</strong> is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you don’t <em>ever </em>plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Protective-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0DMV31N3F\"><strong>$29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor</strong></a> is a suitable option. It fits around every nook and port of the Switch 2, with openings for its speakers and air intake. It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its original dock.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Spigen Rugged Armor for Nintendo Switch 2</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/spigenruggedarmor.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Protective-Ergonomic-Compatible/dp/B0DMV31N3F\"> <strike>$39.99</strike> $29.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.spigen.com/products/nintendo-switch-series-case-rugged-armor\"> $39.99 at <strong>Spigen</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>The </strong><a href=\"https://jsaux.com/products/split-protective-case-for-switch-2\"><strong>JSAUX Split Protective Case</strong></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This case features many of the qualities that I like about the Dbrand Killswitch for a lot less ($29.99 versus $59.99), even one-upping it by being able to fit into the Switch 2’s original dock without the need for an adapter.

To me, it’s freeing. Using a case relieves me of the worry that it will accumulate tons of little scratches. So, I wasted no time testing cases on the new Nintendo Switch 2, and it didn’t take long for me to find one that I think is the best.\nI tried several types of cases on the Switch 2. I tested flimsy shells that snap or slide onto the Switch 2 to provide a simple, aesthetically pleasing barrier from scratches to the console and its Joy-Cons. I also tried slim cases that have one job: to protect the console when it isn’t in use.\nI just listed my high standards for form-fitting cases made to fit the Switch 2 while it’s in use. However, the bar for slim zip-up/clasp cases is lower. They just need to protect the console and, ideally, provide some extra value, like a pocket for cables, cartridge storage, or both, ideally.\nAs for my favorite case, I didn’t want to make any major compromises; I wanted one that’s just as good for handheld mode as when docked, which is why I think the Dbrand Killswitch is the best model overall. I published a full review of the Killswitch, but the skinny is that while it’s perhaps more expensive than some may hope to pay, the level of protection and versatility it offers is worth the cost.\nThe best Switch 2 case for both handheld and docked play\nDbrand Killswitch – Switch 2\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nVery secure fit\nMakes the Switch 2 feel more like a Steam Deck (in the best ways)\nClever dock adapter\n\nChunky dock adapter\nNot the most affordable case\nFront protection only comes in the $80 tier\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 at Dbrand\n\nThe least expensive Killswitch tier costs $59.95 and includes a rear cover for the console and a small piece to adhere to its kickstand for a matching style, plus Joy-Con 2 grips, all of which securely latch onto each component. It also includes a skin for your hardware. There’s no piece of the Killswitch that feels like it’ll incidentally wiggle off. \nUnfortunately, the Switch 2 console case makes it impossible to fit into the dock. However, Dbrand includes its workaround adapter that fits into it, essentially acting as a USB-C extender. It’s a fairly elegant solution that works as intended. The only downside is that it leaves your Switch 2’s screen exposed instead of concealed by the dock’s plastic wall. It’s a little clunky, but I’m willing to forgive it because it allows the Switch 2 to retain its docking functionality.\nThe tier I recommend for most Switch 2 players (especially those who will often throw their console into a bag) is the $79.85 “Travel” tier, which includes a semi-transparent travel cover that protects the front of your console during transit, or just for safekeeping when you aren’t using it. The cover fits around the front of your Killswitch-equipped console, securing around the back with a tough bungee cord latch. This tier also includes a pair of analog stick grips and a tray that holds 10 Switch cartridges and fits neatly within the travel cover.\nWhen this post originally went live, Dbrand was in the midst of updating its Killswitch so that it wouldn’t allow the Joy-Con 2s’ magnets to break away without pressing their release buttons. Basically, if you held your Killswitch-equipped Switch 2 parallel to the ground solely by either of the Joy-Con 2 controllers and give it a shake, the entire console portion was likely to detach, potentially causing serious damage to the console. Dbrand redesigned the Joy-Con 2 grips to fix the issue, and previous buyers can request a replacement free of charge. Future buyers will receive the Killswitch with the updated, improved grips.\nRunner-up\nGenki’s Attack Vector case is similar in some ways to the Killswitch, as it consists of three pieces: one that goes around the console, and two pieces that wrap around each of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. The $49.99 kit improves on the Killswitch with swappable modular grips that come in three sizes to let you customize how the Joy-Con 2 fits in your hand. It follows a small, medium, and large model, with the smallest adding some minor ergonomic benefits, and the largest being what large-handed folks will likely gravitate toward to make the Switch 2 comfier to hold. Its large, palm-filling grip feels as good to use as the Killswitch, but it’s a very close race and I’d be smitten to use either.\nHowever, one notable downside with the Attack Vector is that the Joy-Con 2 sleeves can be pulled off with relative ease, unlike Dbrand’s. Their fit is accurate, technically, and they won’t fall off during normal use. But they’re not as secure as I want them to be.\nAlso, Genki advertises that you can keep the Attack Vector on when you insert your console into the Switch 2 dock, but its launch unit doesn’t work as intended. Genki addressed complaints on forums that the case doesn’t fit the console perfectly, and the fixed model is on its way to me at the time of this update. It will ship a replacement middle piece to all who have already purchased the case, and those who buy the case going forward will receive the fixed product.\nThe best slim, protective Switch 2 cases\ntomtoc slim carrying case for the Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $47.99 $33 at Amazon\n\nTomtoc’s FancyCase Slim case has recently become my favorite Switch 2 zip-up case. Starting at around $33 and going up to $39 depending on the style that suits you best, it’s not the most affordable option. But it’s worth the cost if you want better protection than either the PowerA or Belkin cases below can provide. It has less give in its middle section by comparison. Another thing that sets it apart are the bulbous sections on the outer cover, which offer more vertical clearance above the Joy-Con 2’s analog sticks, ensuring they don’t get pressed while your console’s inside. Oh, and it makes color schemes that look like ice cream sandwiches.\nThe FancyCase Slim case is the best option I’ve tried not just for durability but also for a dash of style. That said, it’s short on other perks to justify the price, in case that matters to you. While Belkin’s case features a pocket for storing microSD Express cards, a cable, or any other small trinket like an AirTag to track its location, the only thing inside of this one is what you get in almost any zip-up case: a soft screen-protecting layer that can hold 12 Switch cartridges.\nPowerA Slim Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $19.99 at Amazon\n $19.99 at Best Buy\n\nPower A’s slim zip-up case for the Switch 2 is a simple and inexpensive way to keep your console safe when you aren’t using it. It’s not a hard case, so it won’t survive catastrophic damage, but it’s a fine choice if you don’t want to add a bunch of heft. To that end, it’s one of the slimmest cases that I have tried. \nAt just $19.99 (half the cost of Nintendo’s official carrying case), baseline protection alone would be sufficient, but it offers safe storage for up to 10 Switch cartridges, too. The cartridge holder has a soft bottom that protects the screen, and it can also fold into a tent, allowing the Switch 2 to rest against it (the Switch 2 already has a kickstand for this).\nThis case doesn’t suffer from a negative trait that’s common among other slim cases (some of which are pricier than PowerA’s): being able to press on the Joy-Con 2 joysticks from the outside. Other cases might allow your Switch 2 to suffer some joystick damage unbeknownst to you, but not this one, as well as the others included in this section.\nBelkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Belkin\n\nFor $10 more ($29.99), Belkin’s slim case is better-looking than PowerA’s and is made with better materials. It has a carrying strap, a large mesh pocket, and a secret compartment for an Apple AirTag or similar Bluetooth tracker, all of which the PowerA case lacks. Belkin’s case can carry 12 cartridges, and it’s only slightly thicker than the PowerA case, likely to compensate for whatever cables or small gizmos you might stuff into its pocket. It features deep grooves to fit the Joy-Con 2’s triggers, and its outer shell it tough enough to prevent most accidental presses on the joysticks. It comes in dark gray, cream, and a fun green shade.\nBelkin sells a $69.99 version of its slim case that features everything above and includes a 10,000mAh 20W battery for keeping the Switch 2 charged while it’s inside the case. The company says the battery can fully charge the console 1.5 times. The battery results in a thicker case, and its bespoke compartment only holds the specific Belkin model that’s included, so you won’t be able to swap in a different, faster-charging battery. Neither of those may be deal-breakers for you, but are worth keeping in mind.\nRunners-up\nJSAUX makes a relatively slim zip-up Switch 2 case that absolutely pops with color. Expressiveness is its main appeal, as this $25.99 case slouches on other features you might want. Once it’s opened, all there is to see is a velcro strap that secures your Switch 2. Underneath it is a fabric tray stitched into the case that can hold 12 game cartridges. Like the Belkin and PowerA cases, this one prevents accidental pressing on the Joy-Con 2 sticks through its shell. It’s a little too light on features to recommend broadly, and it’s thicker than the other models.\nGenki’s $42.99 Sleeper Case is a very tough soft case. Its wool-wrapped shell doesn’t have nearly as much give as other slim cases. Plus, its screen guard can carry up to 18 cartridges. However, I dislike how much the Switch 2 moves around when you shake the case (the fit is snug if you have the company’s Attack Vector case equipped). Notably, Genki’s Neil Trachy, who handles marketing and media relations, shared with The Verge that a production error may impact how well its zipper works in the long run, and that a free fix is coming in late July for all who’ve already purchased one (the updated case is on its way to me at the time of this update for testing). The fix will be implemented for all future purchasers of the case. \n“Our Sleeper Case was upgraded to a waterproof zipper last minute and unbeknownst to our production team, the adhesives used were not binding well to the zipper. […] While the case is still rock solid, the weak point will be the glue that holds it all in place.”\nThe best form-fitting shells for the Switch 2 in handheld mode\nThe Killswitch is the best case for handheld mode because it allows you to remove the Joy-Con 2 controllers and includes an adapter to easily connect to the dock. Plus, it offers kickstand access.\nIf you don’t ever plan to connect your Switch 2 to its dock or detach its Joy-Cons, or it’ll be a rare occurrence, you might pick an all-in-one shell that fits completely around the console. It will protect every angle of your Switch 2 from dings and scratches, and may even keep it safe in the event of a drop.\nThe $29.99 Spigen Rugged Armor is a suitable option. It fits around every nook and port of the Switch 2, with openings for its speakers and air intake. It gets bonus points for fitting around the edges of the Joy-Con 2 while providing more pronounced grips, which may be a boon for those who experience hand or wrist pain while holding the console in handheld mode. However, as noted, you’ll need to remove the case in order to install the Switch 2 into its original dock.\nSpigen Rugged Armor for Nintendo Switch 2\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $39.99 $29.99 at Amazon\n $39.99 at Spigen\n\nWhat’s coming next?\nThe JSAUX Split Protective Case\nThis case features many of the qualities that I like about the Dbrand Killswitch for a lot less ($29.99 versus $59.99), even one-upping it by being able to fit into the Switch 2’s original dock without the need for an adapter. I look forward to testing it when it launches.\nUpdate, August 4th: Adjusted pricing details as necessary.

It features a native 144Hz refresh rate with support for up to 288Hz speeds at 1080p when playing games with VRR. However, only two of its four HDMI ports support those speeds; the other two top out at 4K/60Hz or 1440p/120Hz. It also features a dynamic light algorithm to prevent images from appearing washed out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TV boasts up to 2,500 local dimming zones, according to TCL, but that depends on the size you get. The folks at <em><a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/qm7k#:~:text=TCL%2065QM7K-,966,-288\">RTINGS</a></em> found out that the 65-inch version has 966 zones, though even with fewer of them in the 55-inch model, it should still provide good brightness control. Having more dimming zones means the TV can control the brightness of more precise sections of the screen, helping to avoid blooming, which is when an area around the source of light on the screen is too bright, breaking the realism of the image. The QM7K is powered by TCL’s AiPQ Pro processor, which uses AI to manage its contrast, color, clarity, motion, and upscaling. TCL partnered with Bang &amp; Olufsen to provide the TV’s audio system.

The Z85 also supports both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, which minimize screen tearing and other visual artifacts when playing on a PC with a compatible video card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 4K TV features an HCX Pro AI Processor MKII to control its color, contrast, and clarity, optimizing the image and sound quality of whatever you’re watching in real-time.

It was recently<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/analysis/715450/2025-tv-shootout-value-electronics\"> selected as the top TV</a> in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor. Disclosure: <em>Verge </em>editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges. The 55-inch model received a $400 price drop to around $2,598.99 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Processor-Technology-Television-K-65XR80M2/dp/B0DYK995S3\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-65-class-bravia-8-ii-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv-2025/6626032.p\">Best Buy</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. Sony calls the Bravia 8 II its brightest OLED screen yet, and testing <a href=\"https://hometheaterreview.com/vs/sony-bravia-8-ii-65-qd-oled-4k-google-tv-2025-vs-sony-bravia-8-65-4k-oled-tv-comparison/#:~:text=The%20most%20significant%20advantage%20of,off%20the%20screen%20more%20dramatically.\">conducted by <em>Hometheaterreview</em></a> found its maximum brightness was 1,880 nits when viewing HDR content. Its predecessor topped out at 1,300 nits HDR video, or roughly 44 percent dimmer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. The judges in the aforementioned TV Shootout chose Sony’s set as the best model for SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) processing, but third of four models compared for HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing. Any OLED TV can show true black, but judges agreed that the Bravia 8 II pulled ahead in grayscale and contrast when viewing SDR video.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sony says its TV has modes calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services, too. Sony Picture Core is a streaming service that’s available on select Bravia TVs and Sony gaming consoles, and allows you to stream or download 4K movies at far higher bitrates than competing services. The Bravia 8 II comes with 10 credits, which you can use to download movies for offline viewing, and two years of unlimited streaming for films in its catalogue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you want this TV in a larger size, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Processor-Technology-Television-K-65XR80M2/dp/B0DYK7Y2YB\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-65-class-bravia-8-ii-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv-2025/6626032.p\">Best Buy</a> have the 65-inch model marked down to $3,298 ($202 off).</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sony Bravia 8 II</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Sony-Bravia-8-II.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Sony&#039;s Bravia 8 II OLED TV mounted on a wall with tables below it.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Processor-Technology-Television-K-65XR80M2/dp/B0DYK995S3\"> <strike>$2999.99</strike> $2598 at <strong>Amazon (55-inch)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-55-class-bravia-8-ii-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv-2025/6626033.p\"> <strike>$2999.99</strike> $2599.99 at <strong>Best Buy (55-inch)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Processor-Technology-Television-K-65XR80M2/dp/B0DYK7Y2YB\"> <strike>$3499.99</strike> $3298 at <strong>Amazon (65-inch)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"sony-a90k\">LG C4 OLED</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The<strong> LG C4</strong> is the company’s 2024 best all-around OLED TV, and the 65-inch model currently on sale for around $1,396.99 ($204 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1812659-REG/lg_oled65c4pua_evo_c4_65_4k.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-65-class-c4-series-oled-evo-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024/6578042.p?\">Best Buy</a>. Like the G5, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and G5 is its maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, though that will vary depending on the content you’re watching. It has a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. The LG C4 shares many of the same core features as the G5, but at nearly $1,000 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for around $2,496 ($1000 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1812662-REG/lg_oled77c4pua_evo_c4_77_4k.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>LG C4</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">LG’s C4 has the same refresh rate and gaming-centric features, with a fast AI-enabled processor and perfect contrast on its OLED panel.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/LG-4C-1.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1812659-REG/lg_oled65c4pua_evo_c4_65_4k.html\"> <strike>$1596.99</strike> $1396.99 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo (65-Inch)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-65-class-c4-series-oled-evo-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024/6578042.p?\"> <strike>$1599.99</strike> $1399.99 at <strong>Best Buy (65-Inch)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1812662-REG/lg_oled77c4pua_evo_c4_77_4k.html\"> <strike>$3496.99</strike> $2469.99 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo (77-Inch)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"lg-b4\">LG B4</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you love playing games or watching movies, but don’t have space for a massive OLED TV, <strong>LG’s B4</strong> is 48 inches and down to just $599 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024/6584787.p?\">Best Buy</a>. It features a 120Hz panel with support for AMD FreeSync Premium, Nvidia G-Sync, VRR gaming, and a 0.1ms response time just like the premium C4. The 4K set has an a8 AI Processor 4K that’ll upscale non-4K video and optimize video and audio quality better than its predecessor, though not as well as the chips in LG’s higher-end TV models. The B4 also has LG’s Gallery Mode for displaying photos or paintings when you’re not actively using it. If you’ve never tried an OLED TV before, LG’s B4 is an excellent choice at its current sale price. You’ll get great contrast and all of the important gaming features available on higher-end TVs while spending substantially less. <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-55-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2024/6578057.p\">Best Buy</a> has also discounted the 55-inch model down to $999.99 ($200 off).</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>LG B4</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">LG’s B4 has many of the same gaming features as the higher-end C4 and G5, including a 120Hz panel and support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium.

It has a 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 ports (four HDMI ports total), so you can play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. Its two HDMI 2.0 ports are fine for last-generation consoles like the original <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91ConTM-Switch/dp/B0BFJWCYTL\">Nintendo Switch</a>. If you connect a PS5, the TV will adjust its video settings based on the genre of game you’re playing, which is a nice touch, but games on that console will look incredible on any OLED set.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sony’s Cognitive Processor XR powers the A95L, which enables better motion processing so sports and games look less blurry. It also claims to improve the contrast and colors compared to previous generation Sony TVs.

There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.\nRight now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom, or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.\n\nThe best 4K TV deals for most people\nThe best 4K TV deals for those on a budget\nThe best deals on high-end 4K TVs\n\nThe best 4K TV deals for most people\nSamsung Q8F\nSamsung’s Q8F is available for around $697.99 ($50 off) at Amazon and Best Buy for the 55-inch model, which is its lowest price ever and an excellent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.\nThe TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $200 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,899.99 at Amazon and Best Buy.\nSamsung Q8F\nSamsung’s Q8F is an excellent all-around TV thanks to its 120Hz panel, wide color reproduction, and adaptive audio system. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $747.99 $697.99 at Amazon (55-Inch)\n $749.99 $729.99 at Best Buy (55-Inch)\n $2297.99 $1897.99 at Amazon (85-Inch)\n\nTCL QM7K\nIf you want a 55-inch TV with a gorgeous and bright QD-Mini LED panel without spending over $1,000, the TCL’s QM7K is the set to get. It’s currently available for around $698 ($401 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is its lowest price ever. It features a native 144Hz refresh rate with support for up to 288Hz speeds at 1080p when playing games with VRR. However, only two of its four HDMI ports support those speeds; the other two top out at 4K/60Hz or 1440p/120Hz. It also features a dynamic light algorithm to prevent images from appearing washed out.\nThe TV boasts up to 2,500 local dimming zones, according to TCL, but that depends on the size you get. The folks at RTINGS found out that the 65-inch version has 966 zones, though even with fewer of them in the 55-inch model, it should still provide good brightness control. Having more dimming zones means the TV can control the brightness of more precise sections of the screen, helping to avoid blooming, which is when an area around the source of light on the screen is too bright, breaking the realism of the image. The QM7K is powered by TCL’s AiPQ Pro processor, which uses AI to manage its contrast, color, clarity, motion, and upscaling. TCL partnered with Bang & Olufsen to provide the TV’s audio system. You can get a 75-inch model for around $1,299.99 ($700 off) at Best Buy if you need a bigger screen.\nTCL QM7K\nTCL’s midrange QM7K has a QD-Mini LED TV with a 144Hz refresh rate, hundreds of local dimming zones for more precise brightness controls, and a Bang & Olufsen audio system.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199.99 $697.99 at Amazon (55-inch)\n $1299.99 $699.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)\n $1999.99 $1299.99 at Best Buy (75-inch)\n\nPanasonic Z85\nWe have a dedicated section for high-end OLED TV deals below, but Panasonic’s Z85 is such a good value that it deserves consideration for folks who may be on a budget. The 65-inch model is on sale for $799.99 ($1,000 off) at BuyDig and $997.99 ($802 off) at Amazon, which is one of the deepest discounts on our list. The Z85’s OLED panel is its standout feature, as it achieves perfect black levels and vivid color. It has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, and two of its four HDMI ports support that speed at 4K. The Z85 also supports both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, which minimize screen tearing and other visual artifacts when playing on a PC with a compatible video card.\nThe 4K TV features an HCX Pro AI Processor MKII to control its color, contrast, and clarity, optimizing the image and sound quality of whatever you’re watching in real-time. The TV’s audio system features a built-in subwoofer for enhanced bass. The Z85 runs FireOS, Amazon’s entertainment-focused OS, so you have the option to use many functions by asking Alexa via its voice-enabled remote. A 55-inch model of the Z85 is also available at BuyDig for just $699 ($900 off) and $897.99 ($702 off) at Amazon.\nPanasonic Z85\nPanasonic’s Z85 is an incredibly good value for an OLED TV at its size. It has a 120Hz refresh rate screen, support for AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync, and a Dolby Atmos-compatible audio system with built-in subwoofer.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599.99 $699.99 at BuyDig (55-Inch)\n $1799.99 $799.99 at BuyDig (65-inch)\n $1799.99 $997.99 at Amazon (65-inch)\n\nThe best 4K TV deals for those on a budget\nAmazon Fire TV 4-Series\nAmazon’s Fire TV 4-Series is an affordable option if you want to upgrade a smaller HDTV to a 4K model. The 50-inch model is currently on sale for $289.99 ($110 off) at Amazon.The TV features an LED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and support for HDR10 / HLG, which is totally sufficient for casual TV viewing or watching movies and TV shows. It runs FireOS, and comes with a remote that allows you to summon Amazon Alexa with the push of a button for a query or command. You can step up to a a 55-inch model for $359 ($100 off), if you like its modest feature set but want a slightly larger screen.\nAmazon Fire TV 4-Series\nAmazon’s 4-Series TV boasts solid specs, including HDR10 support, making it an extremely affordable option regardless of the chosen size.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399.99 $289.99 at Amazon (50-Inch)\n $459.99 $359.99 at Amazon (55-Inch)\n\nHisense QD7\nIf your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer for its current sale price of around $399.99 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works, but lower your volume first), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for $499.99 ($100 off) at Amazon.\nHisense QD7\nThe QD7 has a QLED panel that can display over a billion colors and supports multiple HDR formats. It can also upscale HD content using AI and offers support for Dolby Atmos.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499.99 $399.99 at Amazon (55-Inch)\n $499.99 $399.99 at Best Buy (55-Inch)\n $599.99 $499.99 at Amazon (65-Inch)\n\nThe best deals on high-end 4K TVs\nSony Bravia 8 II OLED\nIf you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was recently selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor. Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges. The 55-inch model received a $400 price drop to around $2,598.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. \nSony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. Sony calls the Bravia 8 II its brightest OLED screen yet, and testing conducted by Hometheaterreview found its maximum brightness was 1,880 nits when viewing HDR content. Its predecessor topped out at 1,300 nits HDR video, or roughly 44 percent dimmer. \nThe TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. The judges in the aforementioned TV Shootout chose Sony’s set as the best model for SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) processing, but third of four models compared for HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing. Any OLED TV can show true black, but judges agreed that the Bravia 8 II pulled ahead in grayscale and contrast when viewing SDR video.\nSony says its TV has modes calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services, too. Sony Picture Core is a streaming service that’s available on select Bravia TVs and Sony gaming consoles, and allows you to stream or download 4K movies at far higher bitrates than competing services. The Bravia 8 II comes with 10 credits, which you can use to download movies for offline viewing, and two years of unlimited streaming for films in its catalogue.\nIf you want this TV in a larger size, Amazon and Best Buy have the 65-inch model marked down to $3,298 ($202 off).\nSony Bravia 8 II\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2999.99 $2598 at Amazon (55-inch)\n $2999.99 $2599.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)\n $3499.99 $3298 at Amazon (65-inch)\n\nLG C4 OLED\nThe LG C4 is the company’s 2024 best all-around OLED TV, and the 65-inch model currently on sale for around $1,396.99 ($204 off) at B&H Photo and Best Buy. Like the G5, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and G5 is its maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, though that will vary depending on the content you’re watching. It has a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. The LG C4 shares many of the same core features as the G5, but at nearly $1,000 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for around $2,496 ($1000 off) at B&H Photo.\nLG C4\nLG’s C4 has the same refresh rate and gaming-centric features, with a fast AI-enabled processor and perfect contrast on its OLED panel.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1596.99 $1396.99 at B&H Photo (65-Inch)\n $1599.99 $1399.99 at Best Buy (65-Inch)\n $3496.99 $2469.99 at B&H Photo (77-Inch)\n\nLG B4\nIf you love playing games or watching movies, but don’t have space for a massive OLED TV, LG’s B4 is 48 inches and down to just $599 ($100 off) at Best Buy. It features a 120Hz panel with support for AMD FreeSync Premium, Nvidia G-Sync, VRR gaming, and a 0.1ms response time just like the premium C4. The 4K set has an a8 AI Processor 4K that’ll upscale non-4K video and optimize video and audio quality better than its predecessor, though not as well as the chips in LG’s higher-end TV models. The B4 also has LG’s Gallery Mode for displaying photos or paintings when you’re not actively using it. If you’ve never tried an OLED TV before, LG’s B4 is an excellent choice at its current sale price. You’ll get great contrast and all of the important gaming features available on higher-end TVs while spending substantially less. Best Buy has also discounted the 55-inch model down to $999.99 ($200 off).\nLG B4\nLG’s B4 has many of the same gaming features as the higher-end C4 and G5, including a 120Hz panel and support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium. Its AI processor will also improve the quality of non-4K TV shows and movies you watch. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699 $599 at Best Buy (48-inch)\n $1099.99 $999.99 at Best Buy (55-inch)\n\nSony A95L\nSony’s 65-inch A95L is a premium TV with features that should appeal to gamers and cinephiles alike. It has a 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 ports (four HDMI ports total), so you can play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. Its two HDMI 2.0 ports are fine for last-generation consoles like the original Nintendo Switch. If you connect a PS5, the TV will adjust its video settings based on the genre of game you’re playing, which is a nice touch, but games on that console will look incredible on any OLED set.\nSony’s Cognitive Processor XR powers the A95L, which enables better motion processing so sports and games look less blurry. It also claims to improve the contrast and colors compared to previous generation Sony TVs. It has a peak brightness of 1,300 nits according to lab tests by Tom’s Guide, which is higher than most of the other OLED TVs we found on sale.\nThe A95L is a Bravia-series TV, which means it can access Sony’s Picture Core. This video on demand service has the highest-bitrate (aka video quality) of any streaming platform, which means what you watch will look closer to an uncompressed 4K Blu-ray than a 4K stream from Netflix. Its library is limited, but Sony includes 10 credits with A95L, so you can download movies to keep forever, and a 24-month subscription that lets you stream videos from the library.\nIf you want a higher-end OLED TV, Sony’s A95L is a great choice and has features you won’t find on non-Sony TVs. You can also get the 65-inch model on sale for $2698 ($801 off) at Amazon.\nSony A95L\nSony’s XR A95L has a 120Hz panel, 1,300 nit peak brightness, Cognitive Processor XR, exclusive gaming features when it’a connected to a PS5, and can access the high-fidelity Sony Pictures Core streaming service. \n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2799 $1998 at Amazon (55-Inch)\n $2699 $1999 at Best Buy (55-Inch)\n $3499.99 $2698 at Amazon (65-Inch)\n\nUpdate, August 4th: Updated pricing and availability, and added new deals on Amazon’s 4-Series 4K TV and Sony’s Bravia 8 II OLED 4K TV.","summary":"Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2025 at a substantial discount.
