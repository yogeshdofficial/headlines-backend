Still, if you sat out Prime Day this year, there’s still a chance to get that big-screen TV, a robot vacuum, or a pair of wireless earbuds at a steep discount.\n\nSmart home deals\nVacuum deals\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nCharger and cable deals\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nSmartphone deals\nMovies and TV show deals\nDesktop and laptop deals\nTablet and e-reader deals\nTV and streaming deals\nSoundbar and Bluetooth speaker deals\nVideo game deals\nGaming accessory deals\nPC add-on deals\nBoard game deals\nLego deals\nVerge favorites and other miscellaneous deals\n\nSmart home deals\nSwitchBot Smart Switch Button Pusher\nIf you’ve ever wished you had a robot that could push a button for you, that’s precisely what the SwitchBot Bot does.

Still, it’s a solid smart thermostat that’s currently on sale for $83.49 (nearly $47 off) at Amazon, which is its lowest price of the year. Read our review.\nGoogle’s fourth-gen Nest Learning Thermostat is one of the best we’ve tested, and it’s marked down to $219.99 ($60 off) at Amazon. It comes with a temperature sensor you can place in a room that you want to monitor, and it’ll use that reading to decide whether to turn your system on or off. The thermostat learns your HVAC usage patterns over time, so it can automatically heat and cool your home based on your typical schedule. Read our review.\nThe battery-powered Google Nest Doorbell is down to $119 ($60 off) at Amazon, matching its lowest price to date, in the color of your choice. There are certain omissions you’ll encounter with the battery model versus the pricier option. For example, it lacks 4K video and 24/7 capture. If those don’t bother you, this is a solid option, especially in the design department.

The budget robot vacuum features built-in mops, and its cleaning station can store debris from the vacuum, as well as wash and dry the mop components to prevent them from smelling after doing some dirty work.\nIf you don’t need a robot vacuum that can sweep your baseboards or empty its own bin, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $139.99 ($140 off), which is one of its better prices to date. The entry-level robovac isn’t the smartest option available, but it’s at least aware enough not to bump into walls or tumble over stairs. The 11S Max offers good carpet and hard surface cleaning with relative quietness, too, and its 600ml bin is roomy enough to go through several cleanings before it needs to be dumped.\nRobot vacuums are overrated. Black & Decker’s rechargeable Furbuster — now on sale at Amazon and Chewy for $79.99, its lowest price of the year — is a great handheld alternative that’s well-suited for picking up fur, dirt, and other unwanted debris, especially when you tack on the extra-long crevice tool or the included motorized pet brush.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nThe X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $499.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n\n\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nOur favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation.

If you’ve always wanted to give this one a try, you can pick up a digital or physical copy for around $39 ($20 off) at Best Buy or Walmart. Read about the Switch 2 update.\nNot enough people are still talking about Pikmin 4, the latest entry in Nintendo’s chill (yet often chaotic) exploration game. You navigate through environments, collect and command Pikmin with different elemental abilities and weaknesses, and try to save fellow space cadets from strange happenings. All the while, you’re trying to find Captain Olimar, the protagonist of the original Pikmin game. The Switch title is matching its all-time low of $39.99 ($20 off) right now at Best Buy.

It has other issues, such as the current state of gaming on a Windows handheld and its underpowered Ryzen Z2 Go processor, but the 32GB RAM / 1TB storage model is worth considering at its discounted price of $499.99 ($230 off) at Best Buy. That’s a huge discount.\nNex Playground\nWhat if the dream of Microsoft’s Kinect lived on? It does in the Nex Playground, an all-in-one, motion-controlled console filled with kid-friendly games.

The flap that covers its screen when zipped can store 12 game cartridges.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A solid soundbar that can automatically rotate itself to fire sound upwards for Dolby Atmos content seems like it’d be expensive, but <strong>Vizio’s 5.1.2.

As Prime Day 2025 draws to a close, we’ll no longer be updating this article with additional deals and insights. Plenty of great deals remain, however, so be sure to check out all of our Prime Day coverage for anything you may have missed.\nThere are mere hours left of Amazon’s extended Prime Day extravaganza. And, yeah, we’re a little exhausted, but after days of lightning deals and all-time low prices, these discounts won’t be around for much longer. So, if you’ve been hesitant to jump on these laptop deals before heading back to school, now’s your time to act. Typically, Prime Day is your last opportunity to take advantage of bottom-dollar prices until Black Friday / Cyber Monday, so it may be a while before you see prices plummet on a gadget you’re interested in buying.\nIn case you missed it, Apple’s AirPods Pro 2 are still $100 off — their best price to date — and you can save on smart home devices, robot vacuums, fitness trackers, and smartwatches.

It’s regularly $119.99.\nAmazon is hosting a “buy two, get one free” deal on 4K Blu-rays, as well as regular Blu-rays and DVD box sets, covering a wide range of genres.

There are certain omissions you’ll encounter with the battery model versus the pricier option. For example, it lacks 4K video and 24/7 capture. If those don’t bother you, this is a solid option, especially in the design department. Read our review.\nPrime members can snag Govee’s slick RGBIC floor lamp for a mere $59.99, which matches its previous low. This thin, futuristic lamp is ideal for corners, as it can splash colors onto your walls, syncing with your music, or with a color combo that sets the vibes in the room.\nThe cost of the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium fluctuates nearly as much as the temperature each day, but it’s cheaper than ever during Prime Day.

It features Roborock’s best obstacle avoidance, innovative features like dirt detection, and a hands-free dock that makes it an expensive but excellent choice.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799.99 $949.99 at Amazon\n $1799.99 $949.99 at Best Buy\n $1799.99 $949.99 at Roborock\n\n\nDreame X40 Ultra\nWith a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors.

The budget robot vacuum features built-in mops, and its cleaning station can store debris from the vacuum, as well as wash and dry the mop components to prevent them from smelling after doing some dirty work.\nIf you don’t need a robot vacuum that can sweep your baseboards or empty its own bin, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $139.99 ($140 off), which is one of its better prices to date. The entry-level robovac isn’t the smartest option available, but it’s at least aware enough not to bump into walls or tumble over stairs. The 11S Max offers good carpet and hard surface cleaning with relative quietness, too, and its 600ml bin is roomy enough to go through several cleanings before it needs to be dumped.\nRobot vacuums are overrated. Black & Decker’s rechargeable Furbuster — now on sale at Amazon and Chewy for $79.99, its lowest price of the year — is a great handheld alternative that’s well-suited for picking up fur, dirt, and other unwanted debris, especially when you tack on the extra-long crevice tool or the included motorized pet brush.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nThe X10 is a great robovac with excellent AI-powered obstacle detection, powerful oscillating mops, a user-friendly app, and good mapping capabilities.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $799.99 $499.99 at Amazon\n $799.99 $499.99 at Eufy (with code WS24T2351)\n $799.99 $519.99 at Best Buy\n\n\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nOur favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation.

The entry-level earbuds offer reliable performance and satisfactory sound — especially at this price — though they lack wireless charging, multipoint support, and some of the newer frills found on Samsung’s flagship earbuds. That said, they also come with a pair of silicone “wings” to help them stay firmly planted in place, which some considered a hallmark of prior models. Read our review.\nIf you’re an Apple user, there’s no better pair of starter buds than the open-style AirPods 4, which have fallen to a new low of $89 ($41 off) at Amazon and Walmart. The latest model sounds significantly better than the third-gen pair, particularly when it comes to voice calls. More importantly, they offer robust integration with the rest of the Apple ecosystem, letting you take advantage of audio sharing, automatic device switching, hands-free “Hey Siri” commands, Apple TV integration, and more. Read our review.\nSony WH-1000XM6\nSony’s latest pair of flagship headphones offer improved comfort, better noise cancellation, and the ability to charge while in use. They even fold down for travel, which can’t be said about the last-gen XM5. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449.99 $428 at Amazon\n $449.99 $429.99 at Best Buy\n $449.99 $429.99 at Sony\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro\nSamsung’s premium Galaxy Buds 3 Pro sport the same stem-based design and pinch gestures as the standard Galaxy Buds 3, only they deliver better sound, improved ANC, and an in-ear fit with silicone tips.

They’re a pretty notable step up from the prior model — particularly if you use a Pixel phone — with a smaller build, an excellent transparency mode, and some of the best battery life you can get in a pair of noise-canceling earbuds. Read our review.\nSony’s newer WH-1000XM6 are our No. 1 pick for the best ANC headphones, but the prior model remains an excellent alternative at $248 ($150 off), their current price on Amazon. The WH-1000XM5 still offer top-tier noise cancellation and superb sound, along with a helpful transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth support, and other handy features. The only real downside, aside from the plasticky build, is the fact that they don’t fold down like the XM4 and this year’s XM6. Read our review.\nSony WH-1000XM4\nSony’s last-last-gen ANC headphones still offer great sound, last up to 30 hours on a single charge, and provide a comfortable listening experience thanks to their plush ear pads.

With lossless USB-C audio, 50 hours of battery life, Find My support, spatial audio, and comfy ear cups, the Solo 4 gained significant quality-of-life improvements over their eight-year-old predecessors. They still deliver that bass-rich Beats sound, too. Read our review.\nOther than the Beats Studio Buds Plus above, there aren’t a ton of reputable pairs of wireless earbuds that rely on a see-through design. The newer WF-C710N do, however, and they’ve reached a new low price of $78 ($41 off) at Amazon for Prime Day. What’s more, the budget-minded earbuds also borrow some tricks from Sony’s pricier earbuds, including improved noise cancellation and battery life, an automatic pause feature, and touch buttons that allow you to control playback without whipping out your phone.\nSony’s Float headphones are currently down to $78 ($52 off) at Amazon, which is significantly less than their previous low of $108. The Float represent Sony’s take on open-ear headphones, and while we haven’t had a chance to test them (yet), they seem to offer similar features to their like-minded rivals, including IPX4 water resistance, USB-C charging, and generous ear hooks that are designed to keep them firmly in place while you run.\nNothing Ear (a)\nNothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same general design as the company’s previous earbuds — but you can get these in a snazzy yellow. They include ANC, more than decent sound quality, and other features like multipoint for just under $100. Read our impressions.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99 $69 at Amazon\n $99 $69 at Nothing\n\n\nShokz OpenRun Pro 2\nShokz’ best bone conduction headphones yet, with more booming bass than its predecessor.

They’re basically a pair of low-end Bose earbuds in disguise — hell, they even use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose — which means they offer well-balanced sound, solid battery life, and a number of great features for the price. They also block noise more effectively than previous Skullcandy offerings and come in an array of fun colors, including a chic leopard print.\nThe CMF Buds Pro 2 are available starting at $47 ($22 off) from Amazon and Nothing, matching their best price to date. The inexpensive buds come loaded with features, including active noise cancellation, ChatGPT integration, and up to 6.5 hours of continuous playback with ANC enabled.

The entry-level robovac isn’t the smartest option available, but it’s at least aware enough not to bump into walls or tumble over stairs.

It can empty its dustbin and refill its water tanks on its own, providing up to two months of nearly hands-free cleaning.

Thankfully, there’s still something available for every home and budget, whether you’re looking for a robovac with self-extending arms that can pull double duty as an autonomous mop or a basic, budget-friendly option for everyday tidying.\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day discounts on robot vacuums from popular brands like Roborock, Dreame, Eufy, and more, so you can easily find the perfect one to fit your needs. To make sure everybody gets a chance at saving, we’ve also included retailers outside of Amazon that are matching said discounts, meaning you don’t need to pay for a Prime membership to take advantage of many of these deals.\nFeatured deals\nBest robot vacuum / mop hybrid: Dreame X40 Ultra\nThe Dreame X40 features 12,000Pa of suction power and the unique ability to remove and reattach its own mop pads. The mops can also swing out and reach under low furniture, allowing it to clean spots most bots miss.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $699.99 at Amazon \n $1499.99 $799.99 at Dreame\n\nBest budget option: Tapo RV30 Max Plus\nTapo’s RV30 Max Plus is a relatively inexpensive robot vacuum / mop hybrid with room-specific cleaning, carpet boost, smart navigation, and an optional auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $199.99 at Amazon\n $299.99 $209.99 at TP-Link (discount applied at checkout)\n\nA former runner-up: Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop does a swinging, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” It also self-empties its own bin, although you need to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $369.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $369.99 at Best Buy\n\nA newer option: Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20\nEufy’s all-in-one station empties, washes, dries, and refills the Omni C20 between cleanings. The vac also offers 7,000Pa of suction, a rolling brush, a side brush, and a pro-detangle comb to handle debris and unwanted pet hair.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $379.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $379.99 at Eufy (with code WS7DV2EUJHXX)\n\nThe Roborock S8 Max Ultra is $799.99 ($800 off) at Amazon, which beats its previous best price to date. It’s very similar to the MaxV Ultra and offers dual rubber roller brushes, excellent AI-powered obstacle avoidance, and sonic mopping. However, it offers a lower 8,000Pa suction and lacks support for voice assistants. There’s no camera either, which is nice for privacy but not so nice when it comes to obstacle avoidance.\nThe Roborock S8 Plus, one of our favorite budget-friendly robovac / mop hybrids, is on sale for $349.99 ($650 off) at Amazon, which is it lowest price yet. It comes with an auto-empty dock and features a powerful vibrating mop that scrubs floors and can lift itself to avoid getting low-pile rugs wet. The robovac’s dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa suction also do a solid job of cleaning up both carpets and hard floors, while AI-assisted obstacle detection helps it navigate around everyday clutter.\nTapo RV30 Max Plus\nOur favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum offers high-end features, including room-specific cleaning, a capable mop, carpet boost, and smart navigation. It also features an auto-empty dock.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $299.99 $199.99 at Amazon\n $299.99 $209.99 at TP-Link (code applied at checkout)\n\n\nDreame X40 Ultra\nWith a neat ability to remove and reattach its mop pads, the Dreame X40 solves the problem of vacuuming carpets (with 12,000Pa suction power) while also mopping hard floors. Its mops can also swing out and under low furniture, getting where most bots can’t reach.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1499.99 $699.99 at Amazon (for Prime members)\n $1499.99 $799.99 at Dreame\n\nThe Dreame L20 Ultra robovac / mop hybrid is selling for $539.98 ($460 off) at Amazon, which is nearly its lowest price to date. The auto-emptying vacuum isn’t as powerful as the X40 above and lacks self-extending arms for vacuuming, but it does have a self-extending mop that can reach into corners and refill its own water tank. The robovac is also capable of automatically detaching its mop pads when transitioning to carpet and, with 7,000Pa suction and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, it’s a great vacuum for sucking up dirt and debris, too.\nIf you don’t need a robot vacuum that can sweep your baseboards or empty its own bin, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $139.99 ($140 off), which is one of its better prices to date. The entry-level robovac isn’t the smartest option available, but it’s at least aware enough not to bump into walls or tumble over stairs. The 11S Max offers good carpet and hard surface cleaning with relative quietness, too, and its 600ml bin is roomy enough to go through several cleanings before it needs to be dumped.\niRobot Roomba Combo i5\nThe Roomba Combo i5 Plus is the company’s budget vacuum and mop robot with room mapping features but no virtual keep-out zones.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 $179 at Amazon\n $349.99 $199.99 at iRobot\n $349.99 $209.99 at Best Buy (with self-emptying dock)\n\nThe Dreame L10s Ultra is down to $399.99 ($500 off) at Amazon, matching its all-time low price. The robovac / mop hybrid delivers somewhat strong suction of 5,300Pa and features dual oscillating mops that it can wash and dry with its base. It can empty its dustbin and refill its water tanks on its own, providing up to two months of nearly hands-free cleaning. Equipped with AI navigation that uses both a camera and lidar, the L10s Ultra also lets you access a live camera feed through its app — so it can also serve as a pet monitor.\nNarwal’s Freo Z Ultra is on sale for $849.99, down from $1,499.99, at Amazon. The robovac / mop hybrid’s equipped with dual cameras and two AI chips that work together in real time to recognize objects and adapt on the fly, whether that means steering clear of pet waste, deciding how close to get to furniture, or switching to mop-only mode when it detects a wet spill.\nEufy Robot Vacuum Omni C20\nEufy’s all-in-one station empties, washes, dries, and refills the Omni C20 between cleanings. The vac also offers 7,000Pa of suction, a rolling brush, a side brush, and a pro-detangle comb to handle debris and unwanted pet hair.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $379.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $379.99 at Eufy (with code WS7DV2EUJHXX)\n\n\nShark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop mops very well — doing a swinging, scrubbing movement with its rear end when in “Matrix mode.” However, you have to manually fill and attach the mop reservoir and empty the bin when it mops, as it only self-empties in vacuum mode and can only avoid larger objects.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $699.99 $369.99 at Amazon\n $699.99 $369.99 at Best Buy\n $699.99 $369.99 at Shark\n\nThe Shark Ion is on sale for $149.99 ($100 off) at Amazon, which is $30 shy of its best price to date.

It’s only $100, it’s small but loud enough to work just about anywhere, its battery lasts all day and then some, it’s waterproof, and it floats.

Just be sure not to use it in an environment where there isn’t proper ventilation; Thermacell notes that its ingredients shouldn’t be a concern for people or pets, but I don’t want too much insecticide around my loved ones — or my food. <em>— Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Hoto 3.6V Electric Screwdriver Kit (Classic)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Hoto’s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house.

Whether I’m zesting lemons or creating big, pillowy clouds of grated parmesan for my pasta, the Microplane is an absolute pleasure to use.

It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PGZHCXR/\">Anker combination extension cord / power strip</a>. It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB-A and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. —&nbsp;<em>Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Epicka Universal Series Travel Adapter</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">Epicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24699548/Screenshot_2023_06_02_at_4.04.53_PM.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Travel adaptor on power strip connected to phones and laptop.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B0B8SLNBDP/\"> <strike>$23.99</strike> $19.54 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Basically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B0B8SLNBDP/\">this one from Epicka</a>&nbsp;is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. —&nbsp;<em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islet switches</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">A fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards.

The Islets are silent linear switches, with an extra-long spring, so the actuation force curve is strongest right at the beginning and then smooth the rest of the way, giving them an almost Topre-like tactile sensation. (Pitchforks down; I said&nbsp;<em>almost</em>.) They’re an instant upgrade for any hot-swappable keyboard that takes Cherry MX-compatible switches, and I’ve been using them as my daily drivers for a while.

Their answers provide some interesting insights into what the folks here like to use when they’re at the job or enjoying some time off.\nNow that Amazon’s Prime Day is in its final hours, this might be the last time for a while that deals from some of our recent “favorites” articles are available at a substantial discount. We recommend checking them out in case you read about them in the past and thought, “Well, that sort of sounds good, but it’s a bit pricey,” or “that’s pretty cheap, but maybe I’ll wait until the price goes down even more.”\nHere are some of The Verge staff’s most-liked gear that’s now on sale during Prime Day.\nUltimate Ears Wonderboom 4\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $66.49 at Amazon\n $99.99 $69.99 at Best Buy\n\nI try to bring a Bluetooth speaker everywhere with me when the weather’s good. A pool party, a park day, a golf outing, a hang on the back patio — it’s all better with music! There are obviously lots of good speakers out there, but for me, the UE Wonderboom 4 is the perfect one. It’s only $100, it’s small but loud enough to work just about anywhere, its battery lasts all day and then some, it’s waterproof, and it floats. (All the colors look nice, by the way, but… get the blue one.) There are fancier speakers with more features, and the $200 Megaboom does sound a lot better, but I keep a Wonderboom in my trunk, and it has made me the party hero more times than I can count. — David Pierce, editor-at-large\nThermacell E55 Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $17.68 at Walmart\n $34.99 $20.99 at Amazon\n $29.99 at Thermacell\n\nMy biggest deterrent to spending some time outside are bugs, mosquitos specifically. I wish they’d bug off. They have me looking like I’m doing interpretive dancing to avoid being poked. Thankfully, a gadget that I got last year has made it so that I don’t need to be (as) protective of my exposed skin.\nThermacell makes rechargeable and refillable mosquito repellers. I got the E series model, which creates a safe zone where you likely won’t be bitten. It lasts a little over five hours per charge, meaning I get more than one use out of it before needing to charge it again. Just be sure not to use it in an environment where there isn’t proper ventilation; Thermacell notes that its ingredients shouldn’t be a concern for people or pets, but I don’t want too much insecticide around my loved ones — or my food. — Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor\nHoto 3.6V Electric Screwdriver Kit (Classic)\nHoto’s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house. In addition to a USB-C port, the screwdriver comes with a magnetic case and 25 steel bits.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $39.99 at Amazon\n $59.99 $39.99 at Walmart\n\nI picked up Hoto’s electric screwdriver because my former boss at The Verge, Dan Seifert, would often pitch it around gift guide season. I’m glad I did, though, because it now sits alongside a handful of tools I use on an almost weekly basis. I wouldn’t suggest using it for real household projects that require some serious torque, but it’s incredibly handy for tightening the legs on my desk, assembling furniture, and making sure my bike seat isn’t going to come off mid-ride. It’s also equipped with a USB-C port for charging, a nifty LED light that lets you ditch the headlamp, and a case for housing the 25 steel bits. Oh, and it really does make for a great little gift. I guess Dan was right. — Brandon Widder, senior commerce editor\nAnker Nano Power Bank\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $19.99 at Amazon (USB-C)\n $36.43 $17.99 at Walmart (Lightning)\n\nI have a tendency to hold on to my phones as long as they work reasonably well, and although I must admit I’ve been tempted by the Pixel 9A, I will probably still be using my Pixel 6 for a bit longer. The only issue that I’m starting to hit is battery life — after over three years of use, it’s not unexpected that I sometimes hit the 20 percent mark toward the end of the day. So I recently realized that I’m going to have to start carrying around a portable charger. At first, I was going to go with the 20,000mAh Anker Zolo Power Bank, which had gotten a good number of recommendations. But it weighs over 11 ounces and when I dropped it into my bag, it felt like I had added a small brick. That’s why I traded it in for the less powerful but much lighter Anker Nano Power Bank, which plugs into my phone’s USB-C slot like a small add-on peripheral. The Nano weighs only 3.5 ounces and supplies 5,000mAh of battery power — enough to keep me going to the end of the day. And it comes in several pale colors (I chose Ice Lake Blue), which means I can see it more easily in the dark reaches of my bag. — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\nHamilton Beach 3-in-one Egg Cooker\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $20.99 at Hamilton Beach\n $20.95 $19.99 at Amazon\n\nMy body composition has become about 70 percent egg in the blissful month since I bought this cooker. I never want to buy new countertop kitchen appliances, because almost every time I do, they end up dusty in the back of the cabinet, but I’m amazed by how useful this simple Hamilton Beach Egg Cooker is. I can prepare hard- or soft-boiled eggs to perfect consistency in minutes (with no cleanup!), and having it on hand has dramatically cut back on my bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich habit. So it’s good for my cholesterol and my bank account. — Kristen Radtke, creative director\nHydro Flask Standard Mouth Water Bottle (18 oz)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.95 $23.96 at Amazon\n\nThis is a sturdy stainless steel water bottle that keeps water cold as I sip it throughout my workday. What more could you ask for? I take it on trips, too, and while it’s got a few dents from some drops onto concrete, I don’t really care. If anything, the dents add some character and make it mine. — Jay Peters, news editor\nInstant Pot Duo Crisp\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.99 $149.99 at Amazon\n\nFor the past few years, the Instant Pot has been a staple in my kitchen. From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel. — Emma Roth, news writer\nBraun MultiQuick 5 Vario Hand Blender\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.95 $49.99 at Braun\n $69.95 $49.95 at Amazon\n\nHow often do you blend things? Is it never? Maybe the reason is that taking out, assembling, and cleaning up after a normal blender is just way too much work. Do you know how many sauces I’ve thickened since getting an immersion blender? This thing is small, quick to set up, and you can mostly clean it with just a blast under the faucet. You’re going to blend so many things. — Jacob Kastrenakes, executive editor\nGripstic bag sealer 12-pack\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $23.95 $18.95 at Amazon\n $23.95 at Gripstic\n\nIt’s kind of weird how much I like our Gripstics. Bag of chips open? Quick, grab a Gripstic. Kids vibing between two different cereals this week? A well-placed Gripstic will ensure they don’t get all squishy. Tiny package of chocolate chips you used for a recipe that is now kind of open in your cupboard for who knows how long? Just fold the top over, slide a Gripstic on it — the small blue one, thank you — and stop worrying so much.\nI don’t know about you or your family’s shopping and eating habits, but try as we might to shop on the outside walls of the grocery store, we inevitably come home with many products packaged in single-use plastic bags. That in and of itself is a frustration, only compounded by those same products going bad if they’re not stored properly. The Gripstics are a simple solution to this universal problem, and one that I’m certain has paid for itself many times over. — Christopher Grant, group publisher\nSolar Buddies sunscreen applicator\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $11.98 at Solar Buddies\n $15.98 $12.78 at Amazon\n\nAs a pasty redhead from a large ginger family, I relish every opportunity to nag about the importance of wearing sunscreen — especially when the summer heat is pounding and everyone starts getting their fleshy bits out. If you’re someone who avoids applying the stuff because it makes your hands feel gross, then allow me to remove that excuse for you: sunscreen applicators are a convenient and mess-free solution that can help you protect your skin without itching to wipe your greasy hands on clothes or sandy towels.\nThey’re great for applying sunscreen to your kids, too. The Solar Buddies version I use has a big handle, spongy applicator, and a roller dispenser that ensures even small hands have a good grip and don’t look like they’ve dunked themselves in frosting. You just have to fill them with your sunscreen of choice, giving some added flexibility around the brand and SPF (but please, please consider sticking with a factor of 50 plus).\nBecause the applicator screws tightly closed, it can also help prevent any explosions from occurring in your bag compared to the usual squeeze bottles. Nobody likes a sunscreen sandwich. — Jess Weatherbed, news writer\nMagpul DAKA Essential Wallet\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $16.95 at Magpul\n $16.95 $13.56 at Amazon\n\nI spent the better part of a decade trying to find the perfect slim minimalist wallet for carrying a handful of credit cards, debit cards, and IDs, along with a small stash of cash. The winner, which I’ve been carrying every day for close to eight years now, is Magpul’s DAKA Essential Wallet. It’s made from a reinforced polymer fabric with welded seams that make it impressively durable. It’s also got an anti-slip texture that I find adds extra grip so I can easily extract it from even a tight pocket. I ended up buying three so I had backups when it eventually wore out, but am still using the original with minimal wear and tear. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter\nToAuto DS90 Soldering Station\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $47.99 at ToAuto\n $54.99 $39.99 at Amazon\n $59.99 $46.99 at Walmart\n\nMy ToAuto soldering station spent a few years gathering dust, but I finally pulled it out of the closet when I started experimenting with game console repairs. It may not be a Hakko or a Weller, but for $55, it gets the job done. The station is perfect for a beginner like me, as it heats up to 842 degrees Fahrenheit, comes with numerous interchangeable soldering tips, has steel wool for cleaning, and features a handy rack to hold a spool of solder. So far, it’s helped me do things like solder an HDMI port onto a PS4 and install new batteries on old Game Boy games. I expect it’s going to come in handy for many future repairs, too. — Emma Roth, news writer\npaleblue AA USB-C Rechargeable Batteries\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $22.49 at paleblue (4-pack)\n $29.99 $22.49 at Amazon (4-pack)\n\nI used to buy AA batteries in bulk to keep on hand for when my Xbox controller would die in the middle of a game. (And because I have two kids.) I’d resisted my friends’ suggestions to buy rechargeable batteries, thinking back to the old ones my parents used to have, with a big, bulky charging box that took forever. But then one night I came across these $30 paleblue USB-C rechargeable batteries. They’re great. Just plug them into a USB-C source using the included wire whenever you need to juice them up. They last long enough so that I’m not constantly swapping them out. And I can charge all four at once. I have the four-pack but there’s also an eight-pack and a 12-pack, which might be even more handy. — Todd Haselton, deputy editor\nTile Slim\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $29.99 $19.94 at Amazon\n $29.98 at Walmart\n\nMy partner and I were coming back from dinner with a friend the other night, and as the bus roared away, he suddenly realized his wallet was no longer in his back pocket. We called the MTA the next day, and through some miracle, the wallet had been found, and we were able to drive over to the local bus depot and pick it up. But it occurred to me that if he had a tracker in his wallet, we might not have been as worried as to where it was. The next day, I ordered a Tile Slim for that wallet. I’ve actually been using Tile trackers for my own keys and wallet for a couple of years now (although they’ve thankfully only been needed to locate items misplaced in our home). So as nice as the folks at the MTA were — and they were really nice — hopefully, my partner’s new Tile Slim will ensure it’s our last visit there. — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor\nRoyal Kludge Foldable Mechanical Keyboard\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $54.99 $43.99 at Royal Kludge (with discount code HOT20)\n $54.99 $43.99 at Amazon\n\nI can’t help but laugh every time I hear “Royal Kludge,” but this is truly the best folding Bluetooth keyboard I’ve used yet — because it’s the only multi-device keyboard I’ve tried that doesn’t fall off my lap! It’s also a mechanical keyboard with swappable keycaps, but that’s just the cherry on top. For me, the important bits are that it’s easy to type on, I can swap between multiple Bluetooth devices instead of re-pairing, I can plug it in with USB-C whenever Bluetooth won’t work, and it spans both my legs while folding vertically rather than horizontally, so it doesn’t just fall into the gap between my legs like so many rivals do. There really aren’t a lot of multi-device wired / wireless hybrid keyboards out there with USB-C ports. This one’s chunkier than the competition, but it’s a great deal. — Sean Hollister, senior editor\nYnesoer automatic soap dispenser\nA hands-free soap dispenser with a built-in sensor.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $18.5 at Amazon\n\nAfter realizing we’re not a family who likes to get their hands dirty while cooking (we leave that part to mixers and blenders), an automatic soap dispenser has become one of the most-used devices in our kitchen. We opted for a cheap $25 option from Amazon that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple of months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier $80 versions wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. We find we use less soap now that it’s always perfectly portioned out, and buying refills in bulk is much cheaper. There’s now one in every bathroom in our home. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nGouevn soil moisture meter\nGouevn’s cheap meter can quickly test the soil moisture for both indoor and outdoor plants.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $7.97 $6.76 at Amazon\n\nFungus gnats love overwatered soil, so once you’ve gotten rid of them, you’ve got to be careful and diligent about your watering schedule.

Whether I’m zesting lemons or creating big, pillowy clouds of grated parmesan for my pasta, the Microplane is an absolute pleasure to use. We still keep a big, blunt box grater around for the occasional vegetable, but the Microplane’s sharper blades are better for absolutely everything else.\nIt’s not just us, either — we’ve since gifted this twice, to rave reviews. And if you know me in real life, then I’m afraid it’s only a matter of time before a Microplane comes your way, too. — Dominic Preston, news editor\nRavensburger Starter-Set GraviTrax\nAn interactive track system allows you to design and build your own racetracks and experiment with gravity, magnetism, and kinetics.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69.99 $48.99 at Amazon\n\nWhen screen time is over, there’s no building toy, not even Lego, that holds my kid’s attention better than GraviTrax. It lets you build complicated marble runs using myriad components, including ramps, risers, bridges, switches, and launchers — and that’s just the starter set. There are several expansions that add motorized components that can keep marbles rolling indefinitely if assembled correctly, and it’s one of those toys that adults will enjoy just as much as kids do. For younger kids, there’s also now a GraviTrax Junior line with simpler components and larger marbles. – Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nAnker 321 Power Strip\nThis all-in-one 20W power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and one USB-C port.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $25.99 $15.99 at Amazon\n\nNobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.\nOlder buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this Anker combination extension cord / power strip. It’s not a full power strip — just a cube with a few sockets along with USB-A and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.\nThe three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.\nIf you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. — Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor\nEpicka Universal Series Travel Adapter\nEpicka’s universal travel adapter is an all-in-one adapter that includes four different plugs that cover over 150 countries.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $23.99 $19.54 at Amazon\n\nIn my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.\nBasically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.\nThe only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in most countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I’ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. — Victoria Song, senior reviewer\nKailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islet switches\nA fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards. Islets are smooth and quiet, with a long spring that gives them a top-heavy, almost tactile force curve. They’re 3-pin switches, so they work with most hot-swappable mechanical keyboards that take 3- or 5-pin switches.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $59.99 $56.99 at Amazon (90-piece)\n\nThese are my current favorite switches. The Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islets are nearly identical to the fantastic switches in the HHKB Studio, just much less expensive. The Islets are silent linear switches, with an extra-long spring, so the actuation force curve is strongest right at the beginning and then smooth the rest of the way, giving them an almost Topre-like tactile sensation. (Pitchforks down; I said almost.) They’re an instant upgrade for any hot-swappable keyboard that takes Cherry MX-compatible switches, and I’ve been using them as my daily drivers for a while. There’s also a tactile version, which I don’t like as much. Sorry to the Kailh Whales. — Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor\nNinja Fit single-serve blender\nSimple-to-use 700-watt blender that includes two 16-ounce cups and two spout lids.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $69 $59.99 at Amazon\n $69.99 $59.99 at Target\n\nMy wife and I bought this small blender to make ourselves smoothies and protein shakes. It’s now used to make purees for our baby. C’est la vie. — Antonio G.
