The service operates in a small, relatively safe area of Austin from 6AM to 12AM, avoiding bad weather, highways, airports, and complex intersections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Despite those hours, the robotaxi service seems to have gotten off to a slow start. Several invitees had yet to receive the robotaxi app by 1PM ET on Sunday. Sawyer Merritt, who posts pro-Tesla content on X, said he saw 30 Waymo vehicles go by while waiting for Tesla’s robotaxi service to start. Musk posted at 1:12PM that the service would be available later that afternoon, adding that initial customers would pay a “flat fee” of $4.20 for rides — a weed joke with which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/7/17661178/tesla-elon-musk-private-420-share-considering\">Musk has a troubled history</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While riders waited, <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/robotaxi\">the company published a new robotaxi page </a>to its website detailing a lot of the rules and guidelines of the service. Visitors are invited to sign up for updates about when Tesla’s robotaxi service may come to their area. (Musk has said there could be up to a thousand robotaxis on the road “in a few months.”)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After finally being granted access to the app, Merritt posted an image of the service area map, which appeared to cover a small area bordered by the Colorado River to the north, Highway 183 to the east, Highways 290 and 71 to the south, and Zilker Part to the west. </p>\n<div class=\"twitter-embed\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1936863068283154763\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View Link</a></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then the rides began — and they appeared to be mostly uneventful. Several invitees livestreamed themselves summoning their first cars, interacting with the UI, and then arriving at their destination. Several videos lasted hours, as the invitees would conclude a trip and then hail another car immediately after. One tester, Bearded Tesla Guy, described the app’s interface as “basically Uber.” Many had some difficulty finding the pickup location of their waiting Tesla robotaxi. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“This is like Pokemon hunting,” one person on Herbert Ong’s livestream said, “but its robotaxi hunting.”</p>\n<div class=\"twitter-embed\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/herbertong/status/1936854541271744518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View Link</a></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once inside, the Tesla-employed safety monitor would ask the riders to show their robotaxi apps to prove their identities. Otherwise the safety monitors kept silent throughout the ride, despite riders trying to get them to talk. I’m assuming that Tesla will need to come up with some other way to identify their riders if they plan on removing the safety monitors from the passenger seat. Waymo, for example, asks customers to unlock their vehicle through the ridehail app. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The rear screen instructs the riders to fasten their seatbelts, and after pressing an animated “start ride” button, the vehicle gets underway. Riders can also start the ride from a similar button in the app. Since riders are registering for the robotaxi app using their preexisting Tesla profiles, they’re greeted with their preferred music apps on the rear screen with all their playlists and saved tracks. </p>\n<div class=\"twitter-embed\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chazman/status/1936862410339766307\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View Link</a></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The front display shows a visualization similar to consumer vehicles using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving feature — even though Musk had said the robotaxis are running on a special version of FSD that’s not available to the average Tesla owner. There are “pull over,” “stop in lane,” or “support” buttons on the center display. Another tester, Chuck Cook, said the visualization lacked some of the controls that a normal Tesla might have. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pressing the support button places the rider in a queue as they wait for the remote operator to connect.

The vehicles maintained speeds of about 40 mph or slower. Common words to describe the ride was “smooth,” “great,” and “normal.” <a href=\"https://x.com/DirtyTesLa/status/1936873126500921448\">One tester said on X</a> that they got the robotaxi to “mess up” in a way that required the remote operator to help out — though they declined to describe it as a disengagement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ashok Elluswamy, the head of the company’s self-driving team, posted a photo of several dozen people in a room with 10 large monitors on the wall showing live camera feeds from several vehicles. “Robotaxi launch party,” Elluswamy wrote. </p>\n<div class=\"twitter-embed\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aelluswamy/status/1936865682810946035\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View Link</a></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Where Tesla goes from here is the real challenge.

I asked him about them.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Where did you first hear about these notebooks?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I don’t really remember when I first saw the Triangle Notebook. It was probably an Instagram ad. I had kept a link to the notebook’s website in a browser tab on my phone for a few months and kept thinking about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>When did you buy it, and what went into the decision?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I bought it in April, and what really attracted me was how weird it was. Why does the notebook need to be a triangle? Oh, it opens up into a square! Wow, I love that! The main reason I use paper is to doodle, and I thought this shape would inspire me to doodle differently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then I saw this company also made another notebook called the Sidekick that basically looks like an L when opened, so it is angled alongside your computer keyboard. That was <em>so</em> wacky to me. So I bought that one too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What do you like about them?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This seems more like an art experiment than anything. I love objects that make you rethink how they are used. I typically have Post-it notes or a spiral notebook on my desk so I can write something down or doodle during a meeting.

I had kept a link to the notebook’s website in a browser tab on my phone for a few months and kept thinking about it. \nWhen did you buy it, and what went into the decision?\nI bought it in April, and what really attracted me was how weird it was. Why does the notebook need to be a triangle? Oh, it opens up into a square! Wow, I love that! The main reason I use paper is to doodle, and I thought this shape would inspire me to doodle differently. \nAnd then I saw this company also made another notebook called the Sidekick that basically looks like an L when opened, so it is angled alongside your computer keyboard.
