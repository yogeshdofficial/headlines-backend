At $229.99, the Sleep A30 are quite a bit more expensive than <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101667/anker-soundcore-sleep-a20-true-wireless-earbuds-white-noise\">last year’s $149.99 Sleep A20</a>, but the earliest Kickstarter backers can get the A30 discounted to $139.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/ankersoundcore2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.061732835292,100,69.876534329416\" alt=\"A person asleep in bed wearing one of Anker’s Soundcore Sleep A30 wireless earbuds in their ear.\" title=\"A person asleep in bed wearing one of Anker’s Soundcore Sleep A30 wireless earbuds in their ear.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Sleep A30 are slimmer and smaller than previous versions, potentially making them more comfortable to wear overnight.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Anker\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Anker\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Sleep A30 earbuds are now 7 percent slimmer and feature a smaller design that ensures they don’t protrude from your ears so there’s reduced pressure while wearing them and laying on a pillow if you’re a side sleeper. To help you find a snug fit, Anker includes four sizes of silicone ear tips, three sizes of memory foam tips, and three sizes of ear wings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Anker claims the new Sleep A30 block up to 30dB of external noise, but the added ANC, which uses two mics positioned inside and outside your ears, does result in reduced battery life. The A20 could run for up to 14 hours on a single charge, but the A30 max out at up to nine hours on their own, or up to 45 hours with their charging case. However, that’s only when listening to white noise or other sounds designed to help you fall asleep that are stored on the buds themselves.

Previous versions of the Soundcore Sleep earbuds blocked external sounds passively using just a snug fit inside the ear, but the new Sleep A30 finally add ANC while still offering enough battery life to last the night.\nAs with previous versions, Anker is making its new Soundcore Sleep A30 available for preorder through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that’s launching today, while full availability of the earbuds is expected sometime in August 2025 through Amazon and Soundcore’s online store. At $229.99, the Sleep A30 are quite a bit more expensive than last year’s $149.99 Sleep A20, but the earliest Kickstarter backers can get the A30 discounted to $139.\nThe Sleep A30 earbuds are now 7 percent slimmer and feature a smaller design that ensures they don’t protrude from your ears so there’s reduced pressure while wearing them and laying on a pillow if you’re a side sleeper. To help you find a snug fit, Anker includes four sizes of silicone ear tips, three sizes of memory foam tips, and three sizes of ear wings.\nAnker claims the new Sleep A30 block up to 30dB of external noise, but the added ANC, which uses two mics positioned inside and outside your ears, does result in reduced battery life. The A20 could run for up to 14 hours on a single charge, but the A30 max out at up to nine hours on their own, or up to 45 hours with their charging case.
