They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.</p>\n\n<p>Budget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever.

It’s your world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board.

Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly <em>cheap.</em> If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai\">is underwhelming</a> and the most interesting bits <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought\">won’t arrive anytime soon</a>. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"YIwYGs\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/620155/iphone-16e-review-c1-modem-battery-camera\">Read my full iPhone 16E review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"GfPhzN\">The best Android phone under $500</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Google Pixel 9A</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257690_Google_Pixel_9A_AJohnson_0001.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Google Pixel 9A in peony pink on a purple background.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Robust IP68 rating</li><li>Seven years of software updates</li><li>Brighter, bigger screen</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Missing a couple of AI features</li><li>AI is occasionally handy, usually weird</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHV7N4X/\"> $499 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9a?hl=en-US\"> $499 at <strong>Google</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9a-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6612957.p\"> $499.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / <strong>Processor:</strong> Tensor G4 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>5,100mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Google’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside.

They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\nThe best phone under $400\nOther budget phones to consider\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\niPhone 16E\nThe iPhone 16E is the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, bringing flagship-level performance for less than the standard 16. We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what’s included.\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nReliable performance\nGood, if limited, camera system\nIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy\n\nNo MagSafe\n$599 feels like $100 too much\nNo ultrawide\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 at Apple\n $599.99 at Best Buy\n $599.99 at Verizon\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nGoogle Pixel 9A\nThe Pixel 9A adds more robust water resistance and a brighter, bigger screen to what was already a winning formula for a good midrange phone.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nRobust IP68 rating\nSeven years of software updates\nBrighter, bigger screen\n\nMissing a couple of AI features\nAI is occasionally handy, usually weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 at Amazon\n $499 at Google\n $499.99 at Best Buy\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right. \nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9.
