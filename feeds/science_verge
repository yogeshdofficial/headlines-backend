Every company under the sun typically takes part in Prime Day on both big-ticket gadgets and affordable tech. We’ll be covering the best deals on TVs, laptops, headphones, tablets, video games, PC accessories and components, and so much more. \nTo reiterate, Prime Day deals are only for Prime subscribers, so you’ll need a subscription to participate (even if it’s a trial). For those who are between the ages of 18 and 24, you can get a six-month subscription for free, with it renewing after that period at $7.49 per month (half the normal cost of Prime).\nIf you’re unsure as to whether you’ll have time to peruse all of the deals with us, you can opt to get a tidy email digest of only the top deals, both on a regular basis and during Prime Day, by subscribing to our Verge Deals newsletter below.","summary":"Amazon has announced the dates when its annual Prime Day deal extravaganza will kick off, and it’s happening for much longer than usual.

He realized he had been burning out and that he needed to bring in new leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scott didn’t specify who the new owner or owners are, and the company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment sent to its support email address. However, users will be seeing more of two people, who Scott identifies as “<a href=\"https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho\">Foledinho</a> (Victor)” and “<a href=\"https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak\">Rapsak</a> (Marinus),” as they have “come on board to lead this next chapter,” Scott says. “They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the site has changed hands, Scott says that “this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal.” Instead, “this is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scott will also still be a presence. “I’ll still be annoying people on the Mod Author Discord, lurking on the forums, and sticking my nose into community matters when I can’t help myself,” he says.

He realized he had been burning out and that he needed to bring in new leadership.\nScott didn’t specify who the new owner or owners are, and the company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment sent to its support email address. However, users will be seeing more of two people, who Scott identifies as “Foledinho (Victor)” and “Rapsak (Marinus),” as they have “come on board to lead this next chapter,” Scott says. “They’ve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we’re trying to build here.”\nWhile the site has changed hands, Scott says that “this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal.” Instead, “this is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”\nScott will also still be a presence. “I’ll still be annoying people on the Mod Author Discord, lurking on the forums, and sticking my nose into community matters when I can’t help myself,” he says.
