So, we thought we’d list a few in case you have read about them in the past and thought, well, that sort of sounds good, but it’s a bit pricey. (Or — that’s pretty cheap, but maybe I’ll wait until the price goes down even more…)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here  some of our staff’s most-liked gear that is now on sale during Prime Day.</p>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>CamelBak Hydrobak hydration pack</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/man-with-pack.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Biker rider wearing backpack with river and bike in background\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CamelBak-HydroBak-Reservoir-Hydration-Graphite/dp/B01L8JENFO/?th=1\"> <strike>$60</strike> $39.26 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.camelbak.com/shop/packs/bike/hydrobak-light-50oz/CB-2405.html\"> $65 at <strong>CamelBak</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re itching to get out on a bike ride even when it’s 85-plus degrees, you don’t want to be stuck without an adequate supply of water. I only have room for one drink holder on my bike, so I’ve found that it’s just far more convenient to carry water on my back with the aptly named CamelBak Hydrobak hydration pack. It’s a lightweight backpack that holds up to 1.5 liters of water, which it says is enough for a two-hour bike ride.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The backpack also comes with a handy straw that you just lift up and drink from, preventing you from having to stop and drink from your water bottle (unless you’re coordinated enough to take a sip while riding, which I am not). It also keeps your water relatively cool even when the sun is beating down your back.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Aside from storing water, there’s a zipper pocket where you can store car keys, your ID, and other small items.

While it lacks the Series 10’s temperature sensor, EKG, and depth tracking, the SE still delivers excellent value if you don’t need advanced health features. It will also support the next iteration of watchOS, watchOS 26, when it arrives in the fall with its new wrist flick gesture and AI-powered “Workout Buddy.” Read our review.\nApple Watch Ultra 2\nThe rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2 comes in one size: 49mm.

Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we anticipate this to be <em>the </em>best moment of the year to score discounts on headphones, laptops, TVs, gaming gear, and really anything else that might be on your wishlist — or someone else’s. We sorted through thousands of deals, ultimately narrowing it down to including products we’ve tried (many of which we’ve reviewed) and can vouch for.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To repeat, there will be four — count ’em — four days of deals aimed at Prime subscribers, which means you have double the amount of time to save this year. We don’t expect each new day to wipe the slate clean of previous deals and introduce brand-new ones; however, there will likely be some time-sensitive lighting discounts added at intervals throughout, sprinkled on like a garnish. Also, some big retailers outside of Amazon, including Walmart and Best Buy, are also slashing prices, so we’ve added more purchasing options whenever possible.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#prime-day-highlights\">Prime Day highlights</a></li><li><a href=\"#smartphone-deals\">Smartphone deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#desktop-and-laptop-deals\">Desktop and laptop deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#tablet-and-e-reader-deals\">Tablet and e-reader deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#tvs-streaming-monitors\">TV and streaming deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#monitor-deals\">Monitor deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#smart-home-deals\">Smart home deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#robot-vacuum-deals\">Robot vacuum deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#headphone-and-earbud-deals\">Headphone and earbud deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#soundbar-and-bluetooth-speaker-deals\">Soundbar and Bluetooth speaker deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#smartwatch-and-fitness-tracker-deals\">Smartwatch and fitness tracker deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#video-game-deals\">Video game deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#gaming-accessory-deals\">Gaming accessory deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#pc-add-on-deals\">PC add-on deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#charger-and-cable-deals\">Charger and cable deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#movies-and-tv-show-deals\">Movies and TV show deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#verge-favorites-and-other-miscellaneous-deals\">Verge favorites and other miscellaneous deals</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"prime-day-highlights\">Prime Day highlights</h2>\n\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>8BitDo Ultimate 2 wireless controller</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">For something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2.

Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we anticipate this to be the best moment of the year to score discounts on headphones, laptops, TVs, gaming gear, and really anything else that might be on your wishlist — or someone else’s. We sorted through thousands of deals, ultimately narrowing it down to including products we’ve tried (many of which we’ve reviewed) and can vouch for.\nTo repeat, there will be four — count ’em — four days of deals aimed at Prime subscribers, which means you have double the amount of time to save this year. We don’t expect each new day to wipe the slate clean of previous deals and introduce brand-new ones; however, there will likely be some time-sensitive lighting discounts added at intervals throughout, sprinkled on like a garnish. Also, some big retailers outside of Amazon, including Walmart and Best Buy, are also slashing prices, so we’ve added more purchasing options whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Day highlights\nSmartphone deals\nDesktop and laptop deals\nTablet and e-reader deals\nTV and streaming deals\nMonitor deals\nSmart home deals\nRobot vacuum deals\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nSoundbar and Bluetooth speaker deals\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nVideo game deals\nGaming accessory deals\nPC add-on deals\nCharger and cable deals\nMovies and TV show deals\nVerge favorites and other miscellaneous deals\n\nPrime Day highlights\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 wireless controller\nFor something cheaper — and in some ways better — than Nintendo’s official Pro controller, there’s 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2, which works with the original Switch and Switch 2.

The entry-level earbuds offer reliable performance and satisfactory sound — especially at this price — though they lack wireless charging, multipoint support, and some of the newer frills found on Samsung’s flagship earbuds. That said, they also come with a pair of silicone “wings” to help them stay firmly planted in place, which some considered a hallmark of prior models. Read our review. \nIf you’re an Apple user, there’s no better pair of starter buds than the open-style AirPods 4, which have fallen to a new low of $89 ($41 off) at Amazon and Walmart.

They’re a pretty notable step up from the prior model — particularly if you use a Pixel phone — with a smaller build, an excellent transparency mode, and some of the best battery life you can get in a pair of noise-canceling earbuds. Read our review.\nSony’s newer WH-1000XM6 are our No. 1 pick for the best ANC headphones, but the prior model remains an excellent alternative at $298, their current price on Amazon. The WH-1000XM5 still offer top-tier noise cancellation and superb sound, along with a helpful transparency mode, multipoint Bluetooth support, and other handy features. The only real downside, aside from the plasticky build, is the fact that they don’t fold down like the XM4 and this year’s XM6.

They’re basically a pair of low-end Bose earbuds in disguise — hell, they even use licensed technology and audio tuning by Bose — which means they offer well-balanced sound, solid battery life, and a number of great features for the price. They also block noise more effectively than previous Skullcandy offerings and come in an array of fun colors, including a chic leopard print.\nThe Shokz OpenFit are currently on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $109.95 ($50 off), a new low. Like other pairs of Shokz earbuds, they feature a lightweight, open-style design that’s well-suited for both the gym and everyday use, with an IP55 water resistance rating, relatively clear sound, and a decent amount of low-end thump despite their less conventional design.

The 43mm version of the Watch 3 and the new Buds 4 earbuds are the only new products launching in the US, with the others going on sale in Europe and India.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Watch 3 43mm is exactly what it sounds like: a more compact version of the existing OnePlus wearable, which only launched in a single 47mm option. That was my colleague Victoria Song’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/612965/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on-smartwatch-wearables\">“big design gripe” with the original Watch 3</a>, so a fix is certainly welcome. The new version is not only much smaller, but also drops the angular elements around the rotating crown and button for a simpler, circular design that’s less distinctive, but which I certainly prefer.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-nord-5-launch-4.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.727674351922,100,78.544651296157\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Watch 3 43mm is smaller, but also drops the angular aesthetic.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-nord-5-launch-3.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The demo unit I saw was stuck in pairing mode, so I didn’t get to try the new health features.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The compact design comes at a cost to battery though. OnePlus says the new Watch 3 is 7 percent thinner and 28 percent lighter than the original, but it has just 50 percent of the battery life. That’s still 60 hours on typical settings, but a far cry from the 120-hour battery life that was a key selling point first time round. That’s despite using a much less bright display, with 1,000 nits of peak brightness, down from 2,200 in the 47mm model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As before, it runs on Wear OS and is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chipset, with a second low-power chip to help with battery life. There are some new features too, with reproductive cycle tracking, and an updated version of its “Wellness” score that claims to use the watch’s barometer to measure your fatigue levels and show you a corresponding emoji as a result. The Watch 3 43mm is available from the OnePlus website from today for $299.99 —&nbsp;$100 less than the larger model —&nbsp;and will arrive on Amazon and Best Buy in August. In Europe it’ll set you back €299 / £269.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-nord-5-launch-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.737777045019,100,78.524445909961\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Buds 4 come in pale green or dark gray.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-nord-5-launch-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;This concave touch surface isn’t entirely new, but it’s a nice touch.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other US release is the Buds 4, a new pair of affordable earbuds.

I’m a fan of the slightly concave touch controls, which make it easier to feel where you’re meant to swipe and tap.

This midrange phone launches in Europe for €449 / £399, powered by the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24101903/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-chipset-on-device-ai\">Snapdragon 8S Gen 3</a>. There’s a clear gaming focus, with a 144Hz OLED display, but also an unexpectedly capable 50-megapixel selfie camera. This one’s for the kids, I guess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s a big phone, with a 6.83-inch display, but it’s relatively slim and light, so doesn’t feel too bulky from my time testing the phone so far. It also follows the Asia-only OnePlus 13S (known as the 13T in China) in dropping the company’s classic Alert Slider in favor of a new button, the Plus Key. This is fully customizable, but by default triggers (you guessed it!) <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/674506/oneplus-13s-ai-plus-mind-key-button-india-availability\">AI stuff</a>. I’m reviewing the Nord 5 right now, so we’ll have a full verdict on the phone soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s joined by the Nord CE 5, a €349 / £299 handset that looks similar but makes compromises across the board. It’s a hair smaller, with a 6.77-inch screen, and drops to a slower MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Apex chipset. The screen has a lower resolution, refresh rate, and peak brightness, and the camera specs are less impressive too, though at least it includes the same 5,200mAh battery and 80W charging speed as the Nord 5, and a similar promise of four years of OS updates. I’d pay a little more for the Nord 5 if you can afford to.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-nord-5-launch-8.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;I didn’t miss this weird, central, circular camera.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, the Pad Lite is a cheaper take on the OnePlus tablet line-up. I’m disappointed to see it uses the ugly circular camera design of the older Pads (since changed on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/681301/oneplus-pad-3-review\">recent Pad 3</a>), but otherwise there’s a lot to like for the price. It has an 11-inch, 2K display (though only at 90Hz), and a decently sized 9,340mah battery. It’s just €229 / £199, but an extra €30 / £30 will net you more RAM, double the storage, and LTE support, which sounds like a bargain.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"OnePlus has launched five new products today, including the midrange Nord 5 phone and a smaller version of its Watch 3 wearable.

Available in green or gray, these support both Hi-Res and spatial audio, powered by dual 11mm and 6mm drivers in each bud. I’m a fan of the slightly concave touch controls, which make it easier to feel where you’re meant to swipe and tap. They cost $129.99 in the US, and €119 / £119 in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nord 5 is the star of the other launches, though it won’t come to the US. This midrange phone launches in Europe for €449 / £399, powered by the Snapdragon 8S Gen 3. There’s a clear gaming focus, with a 144Hz OLED display, but also an unexpectedly capable 50-megapixel selfie camera. This one’s for the kids, I guess. \nIt’s a big phone, with a 6.83-inch display, but it’s relatively slim and light, so doesn’t feel too bulky from my time testing the phone so far. It also follows the Asia-only OnePlus 13S (known as the 13T in China) in dropping the company’s classic Alert Slider in favor of a new button, the Plus Key. This is fully customizable, but by default triggers (you guessed it!) AI stuff. I’m reviewing the Nord 5 right now, so we’ll have a full verdict on the phone soon.\nIt’s joined by the Nord CE 5, a €349 / £299 handset that looks similar but makes compromises across the board. It’s a hair smaller, with a 6.77-inch screen, and drops to a slower MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Apex chipset. The screen has a lower resolution, refresh rate, and peak brightness, and the camera specs are less impressive too, though at least it includes the same 5,200mAh battery and 80W charging speed as the Nord 5, and a similar promise of four years of OS updates. I’d pay a little more for the Nord 5 if you can afford to.\nFinally, the Pad Lite is a cheaper take on the OnePlus tablet line-up. I’m disappointed to see it uses the ugly circular camera design of the older Pads (since changed on the recent Pad 3), but otherwise there’s a lot to like for the price. It has an 11-inch, 2K display (though only at 90Hz), and a decently sized 9,340mah battery. It’s just €229 / £199, but an extra €30 / £30 will net you more RAM, double the storage, and LTE support, which sounds like a bargain.","summary":"OnePlus has launched five new products today, including the midrange Nord 5 phone and a smaller version of its Watch 3 wearable.

Despite <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22188428/google-fitbit-acquisition-completed-approved\">getting acquired by Google</a>, Fitbit remains one of the most recognizable names in the industry. Fitbit trackers aren’t meant for the most hardcore of athletes, but they’re still excellent devices for tracking overall activity as well as monitoring certain health and wellness metrics like EKGs and blood oxygen levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That said, this is a transitional period from the Fitbit of old to whatever Fitbit will be in the future. 2023, in particular, was a messy year. There were multiple Fitbit server outages, and I wasn’t impressed with the decision to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/17/23603101/fitbit-google-challenges-adventures-community\">sunset legacy community features</a> like challenges or the fact that all Fitbit accounts will soon require you <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/26/23372438/fitbit-changes-update-google-account-new-2025\">to log in via Google</a>. Speaking of which, the Fitbit-to-Google account migration <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/11/23677684/fitbit-google-account-login-migration\">started in 2023</a> and is required if you buy newer products like the Fitbit Charge 6 or Google Pixel Watch 3. The Fitbit app also got <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/1/23814481/fitbit-app-redesign-google-pixel-watch-2\">a new, more Google-like makeover</a>, which didn’t go over well with many users. (Google has since made adjustments based on feedback.) And in 2024, much of Fitbit’s leadership, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033994/google-reorganization-fitbit-park-friedman-ar-layoffs\">co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman, left the company</a> as roughly <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034124/google-layoffs-engineering-assistant-hardware\">a thousand Google employees</a> were laid off.</p>\n\n<p>You can look at how Google has handled the Nest acquisition as a road map to how things are going. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23972335/smartwatches-2023-fitbit-google-integration\">Googlefication of Fitbit</a> will continue, but there are reasons to stick with its trackers in the meantime. Fitbit trackers are relatively affordable, especially since they often go on sale.&nbsp;All the devices also come with a free trial to <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/services/premium\">Fitbit Premium</a>, the company’s subscription service that adds guided workouts, meditations, and access to more in-depth metrics. So far, it appears Google takes its Pixel Watch lineup seriously, too. With the Pixel Watch 2, the company expanded extended warranty access and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24070925/googles-launching-a-pixel-watch-2-mail-in-replacement-service\">improved replacement options</a>.

Technically, it’s a Google product, but Google owns Fitbit, so they’re <em>all</em> Google products now. Fitbit powers all of the Pixel Watch’s health and fitness features. But really, this is the smartwatch that Fitbit never could manage to build on its own.</p>\n\n<p>The Pixel Watch 3 is a significant update over its predecessors. It finally feels like Google’s no longer playing catch-up to its rivals. This year, the screens are brighter, the bezels are smaller, and there’s now a 45mm size for larger wrists. The larger size doesn’t look chunky, either. Internally, the processor and health sensors are the same as last year, though the third-gen device has an ultra wideband chip that allows you to unlock Pixel phones and some BMW car models.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25610299/247234_Pixel_Watch_3_AKrales_0205.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"The 45mm and 41mm Pixel Watch 3 in colorful boxes\" title=\"The 45mm and 41mm Pixel Watch 3 in colorful boxes\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 45mm watch (top) doesn’t appear that much larger than the 41mm (bottom) when worn on the wrist.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>It’s got the same beautiful design with a circular domed display that looks way more elegant than the squircle Versa or Sense smartwatches ever did. On your wrist, it looks like a watch<em>,</em> not a tracker dressed up as one.&nbsp;The display is a bit fragile for our taste, but as 2023, you can get a Preferred Care extended warranty in the US and Canada. This is one reason we recommend the Pixel Watch 3 over the original since at least you have a more affordable fallback should something happen to your display. Google also announced an option where you can skip customer support and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24070925/googles-launching-a-pixel-watch-2-mail-in-replacement-service\">mail in broken, out-of-warranty Pixel Watch</a> devices for discounted replacements.</p>\n\n<p>As for fitness features, the Pixel Watch 3 is much better for runners than it used to be. It includes a new running dashboard, advanced form analytics, custom running workouts, and even AI-generated workout suggestions. It’s also introduced a new metric called Cardio Load, which measures the intensity of your workouts and suggests a target based on your fitness goals. It’s conceptually similar to Garmin’s Training Load. The Daily Readiness Score has also been revamped and is no longer locked behind the Fitbit Premium paywall. On the health front, European users now have Loss of Pulse. If the watch detects you’ve lost your pulse, it’ll call emergency services on your behalf. The feature isn’t available yet in the US, though, as FDA clearance is still pending.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Google has strengthened the watch’s integrations with its own services as well as other Pixel devices. For instance, you have offline Google Maps and a Google Home Tile. You can view your Nest Doorbell camera feed or control your Google TV from your wrist, and there’s also the option to record audio with the Recorder app and transfer it to your phone. With Call Assist, you can use your watch to tell anyone calling you need an extra second to pick up the phone.</p>\n\n<p>If all you want is a fitness tracker that <em>looks</em> like a smartwatch, you can consider the $229 <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/fitbit_versa_4/\">Versa 4</a> since it’s the more budget-friendly option. But there’s no real point in the <a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/product/fitbit_sense_2/\">Sense 2</a> since the Pixel Watch 3 can do all the same things — and more.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"OgkIoU\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Read my full Pixel Watch 3 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e2fZ4X\">Best budget Fitbit</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Fitbit Inspire 3</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24016864/226269_FITBIT_INSPIRE_3_PHO_vsong_0004.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"The Fitbit Inspire 3 on top of a plant\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Good entry-level fitness &amp; sleep tracker</li><li>Bright OLED display</li><li>Lightweight</li><li></li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Huge bezels</li><li>Limited features compared to cheaper Amazfit Band 7</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5F9SZW7\"> <strike>$99.95</strike> $79.95 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://howl.me/cj9WQeWxrAP\"> <strike>$99.95</strike> $79.95 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/fitbit_inspire_3/\"> <strike>$99.95</strike> $79.95 at <strong>Google</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p>The Inspire line hasn’t always felt, well, <em>inspired</em>. But the $99.95 Inspire 3 is different. With a color OLED display, it’s reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22386394/fitbit-luxe-fitness-wellness-tracker-price-release-date-features\">Fitbit Luxe</a> of 2021, only with a matte black plastic case instead of a metal one. It’s a great throwback to classic Fitbits for people who only want the basics.</p>\n\n<p>The Inspire 3 doesn’t overcomplicate things. It’s a fitness band. You won’t get built-in GPS, contactless payments, or digital assistants. Still, what it lacks in smarts it makes up for with Fitbit’s advanced sleep tracking, stress management features, and irregular heart rate notifications. The OLED display is also a step up from the Inspire 2’s monochrome screen, and you still get 10 days of battery life. (Though it’s more like two to three if you enable the always-on display.)&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24016863/226269_FITBIT_INSPIRE_3_PHO_vsong_0003.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close up of Fitbit Inspire 3 screen.

It’s Fitbit’s higher-end fitness band but easily competes with the more expensive <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/global/us/products/smartwatches/versa4\">Versa 4</a> on features. It features a color OLED screen plus an EKG and EDA sensor. You also get built-in GPS, NFC payments, and SpO2 sensors — the only thing you’re really missing is a digital assistant.</p>\n\n<p>The only qualm we have with the Charge 6 is the always-on display. While it’s beautiful, it’s a major battery drain. The Charge 6 has an estimated seven days of battery life, but that dwindles down to about two if you have the always-on display enabled. This is the same issue that we had with the Charge 5, but it’s fairly typical for Fitbit trackers these days.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, though, you’re getting a hell of a lot for the price. It’s the only FDA-cleared EKG wearable you can find for under $200, and the only other Fitbits capable of EKG and EDA readings are the Sense, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23392564/fitbit-sense-2-review-google-fitness-tracker\">Sense 2</a>, and the Pixel Watch 2.

Despite getting acquired by Google, Fitbit remains one of the most recognizable names in the industry. Fitbit trackers aren’t meant for the most hardcore of athletes, but they’re still excellent devices for tracking overall activity as well as monitoring certain health and wellness metrics like EKGs and blood oxygen levels. \nThat said, this is a transitional period from the Fitbit of old to whatever Fitbit will be in the future. 2023, in particular, was a messy year. There were multiple Fitbit server outages, and I wasn’t impressed with the decision to sunset legacy community features like challenges or the fact that all Fitbit accounts will soon require you to log in via Google. Speaking of which, the Fitbit-to-Google account migration started in 2023 and is required if you buy newer products like the Fitbit Charge 6 or Google Pixel Watch 3. The Fitbit app also got a new, more Google-like makeover, which didn’t go over well with many users. (Google has since made adjustments based on feedback.) And in 2024, much of Fitbit’s leadership, including co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman, left the company as roughly a thousand Google employees were laid off.\nYou can look at how Google has handled the Nest acquisition as a road map to how things are going. The Googlefication of Fitbit will continue, but there are reasons to stick with its trackers in the meantime. Fitbit trackers are relatively affordable, especially since they often go on sale. All the devices also come with a free trial to Fitbit Premium, the company’s subscription service that adds guided workouts, meditations, and access to more in-depth metrics. So far, it appears Google takes its Pixel Watch lineup seriously, too. With the Pixel Watch 2, the company expanded extended warranty access and improved replacement options. You just have to go in with eyes wide open.\nIf you’re not dead set on a Fitbit in particular, check out our guide to the best fitness trackers and watches.\nBest Fitbit smartwatch\nPixel Watch 3 (41mm, Bluetooth)\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nWe finally get a bigger size!\nModerate battery improvements\nLots of neat Google integrations\nGood running updates\nReadiness and Cardio Load scores not locked behind paywall\n\nIt’s best with a Pixel phone\nLoss of Pulse detection is Europe-only for now\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $349.99 at Amazon\n $349.99 at Best Buy\n $349.99 at Google\n\nThe existence of the Pixel Watch, now in its third generation, has thrown a wrench into Fitbit’s smartwatch lineup. Technically, it’s a Google product, but Google owns Fitbit, so they’re all Google products now. Fitbit powers all of the Pixel Watch’s health and fitness features. But really, this is the smartwatch that Fitbit never could manage to build on its own.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 is a significant update over its predecessors. It finally feels like Google’s no longer playing catch-up to its rivals. This year, the screens are brighter, the bezels are smaller, and there’s now a 45mm size for larger wrists. The larger size doesn’t look chunky, either. Internally, the processor and health sensors are the same as last year, though the third-gen device has an ultra wideband chip that allows you to unlock Pixel phones and some BMW car models.\nIt’s got the same beautiful design with a circular domed display that looks way more elegant than the squircle Versa or Sense smartwatches ever did. On your wrist, it looks like a watch, not a tracker dressed up as one. The display is a bit fragile for our taste, but as 2023, you can get a Preferred Care extended warranty in the US and Canada. This is one reason we recommend the Pixel Watch 3 over the original since at least you have a more affordable fallback should something happen to your display. Google also announced an option where you can skip customer support and mail in broken, out-of-warranty Pixel Watch devices for discounted replacements.\nAs for fitness features, the Pixel Watch 3 is much better for runners than it used to be. It includes a new running dashboard, advanced form analytics, custom running workouts, and even AI-generated workout suggestions. It’s also introduced a new metric called Cardio Load, which measures the intensity of your workouts and suggests a target based on your fitness goals. It’s conceptually similar to Garmin’s Training Load. The Daily Readiness Score has also been revamped and is no longer locked behind the Fitbit Premium paywall. On the health front, European users now have Loss of Pulse. If the watch detects you’ve lost your pulse, it’ll call emergency services on your behalf. The feature isn’t available yet in the US, though, as FDA clearance is still pending.\nAdditionally, Google has strengthened the watch’s integrations with its own services as well as other Pixel devices. For instance, you have offline Google Maps and a Google Home Tile. You can view your Nest Doorbell camera feed or control your Google TV from your wrist, and there’s also the option to record audio with the Recorder app and transfer it to your phone. With Call Assist, you can use your watch to tell anyone calling you need an extra second to pick up the phone.\nIf all you want is a fitness tracker that looks like a smartwatch, you can consider the $229 Versa 4 since it’s the more budget-friendly option. But there’s no real point in the Sense 2 since the Pixel Watch 3 can do all the same things — and more.\nRead my full Pixel Watch 3 review.\nBest budget Fitbit\nFitbit Inspire 3\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGood entry-level fitness & sleep tracker\nBright OLED display\nLightweight\n\n\nHuge bezels\nLimited features compared to cheaper Amazfit Band 7\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.95 $79.95 at Amazon\n $99.95 $79.95 at Best Buy\n $99.95 $79.95 at Google\n\nThe Inspire line hasn’t always felt, well, inspired. But the $99.95 Inspire 3 is different. With a color OLED display, it’s reminiscent of the Fitbit Luxe of 2021, only with a matte black plastic case instead of a metal one. It’s a great throwback to classic Fitbits for people who only want the basics.\nThe Inspire 3 doesn’t overcomplicate things. It’s a fitness band. You won’t get built-in GPS, contactless payments, or digital assistants. Still, what it lacks in smarts it makes up for with Fitbit’s advanced sleep tracking, stress management features, and irregular heart rate notifications. The OLED display is also a step up from the Inspire 2’s monochrome screen, and you still get 10 days of battery life. (Though it’s more like two to three if you enable the always-on display.) \nThe Inspire 3 has a variety of accessories, including a clip attachment if you want to track steps discreetly. There’s even a gold or silver mesh strap if you want to dress it up a bit. \nTo be honest, the Inspire 3 and Luxe are quite similar, and they’re often around the same price. It’ll boil down to whether you think the Luxe’s nicer case is worth trading half the battery life for — the Luxe gets an estimated five days instead of 10.\nRead our coverage of the Fitbit Inspire 3 here.\nBest Fitbit fitness tracker\nFitbit Charge 6\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSolid fitness and health tracking feature set\nIt’s $20 cheaper!\nAdds more apps\nCan broadcast HR to fitness equipment\nThe haptic button is better than the groove\n\nYouTube Music is the only option and that’s $11 monthly\nThe Fitbit-Google transition is a lil bumpy\nIt’s not a physical side button\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $159.95 $109.95 at Amazon\n $159.95 $109.95 at Best Buy\n $159.95 $109.95 at Google\n\nThe Charge series has always been popular, and the $159.95 Charge 6 is no exception. It’s Fitbit’s higher-end fitness band but easily competes with the more expensive Versa 4 on features. It features a color OLED screen plus an EKG and EDA sensor. You also get built-in GPS, NFC payments, and SpO2 sensors — the only thing you’re really missing is a digital assistant.\nThe only qualm we have with the Charge 6 is the always-on display. While it’s beautiful, it’s a major battery drain. The Charge 6 has an estimated seven days of battery life, but that dwindles down to about two if you have the always-on display enabled. This is the same issue that we had with the Charge 5, but it’s fairly typical for Fitbit trackers these days.\nAltogether, though, you’re getting a hell of a lot for the price. It’s the only FDA-cleared EKG wearable you can find for under $200, and the only other Fitbits capable of EKG and EDA readings are the Sense, Sense 2, and the Pixel Watch 2. So unless you’re dead set on the smartwatch form factor, the Charge 6 is the better overall deal. \nCompared to its predecessor, the Charge 6 also adds an improved heart rate algorithm, Bluetooth compatibility with some gym equipment, and a few apps — namely Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music. While YouTube Music works well, I’m not stoked that it requires an additional $11 monthly subscription. That said, it’s better than nothing, as Fitbit discontinued onboard music a while back.\nIn terms of hardware, the Charge 6 also features a haptic button instead of an inductive groove. It’s not a physical button, which is a little disappointing, but it’s more reliable thus far than the inductive groove, so I would count this as a net positive.\nYou could technically get the Charge 5 at a discount. However, I’d only do that if it’s significantly cheaper and price is your main consideration.

Turn-by-turn navigation is also handy for walks, and it at least offers some form of music playback.\nRead our Fitbit Charge 6 review.\nBest Fitbit for kids\nFitbit Ace LTE\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat build quality for a kids’ watch\nCross platform\nFun games that require physical activity to unlock\nVoice calls and text messaging with preselected contacts\nFamily group chat\n\nYou’ll have to charge it every night\nOnly two color options (but multiple band options)\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.95 at Amazon\n $179.99 at Best Buy\n $179.99 $139.99 at Google\n\nThe $179.99 Fitbit Ace LTE isn’t really a traditional fitness tracker, though it does track active minutes.
