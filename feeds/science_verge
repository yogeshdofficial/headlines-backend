Multiple retailers dropped a selection of early discounts in the run-up to the holiday, and now that it’s officially here, we’re seeing deals on everything from basic essentials to big-ticket favorites of ours.\nBelow, we’ve rounded up a few highlights, from LG’s C4 OLED TV to Garmin’s Forerunner 265, both of which are down to their best price to date. We’ve also included practical (and affordable) finds like video doorbells and location trackers, along with a selection of miscellaneous gems, from discounted MacBooks and Glocuscent’s wearable book light to other nifty trinkets that’ll make life a little better. Whether you’re shopping for yourself or hunting for a last-minute graduation gift, there’s a little something for everyone, so let’s dive in.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker deals\nEarbud and headphone deals\nTV and streaming device deals\nSmart home deals\nSmartwatch and wearable deals\nTablet deals\nOutdoor and travel deals\nOther miscellaneous deals\n\nSpeaker deals\nThe second-gen Sonos Roam is available for an all-time low of $134 ($45 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Sonos. Unlike its predecessor, the portable speaker is ready to use right out of the box and features a dedicated button for Bluetooth pairing. It isn’t as powerful as the Move 2 — and it doesn’t offer line-in support — but it still sounds great and integrates well with the rest of the Sonos ecosystem, which makes it relatively easy to switch music between the company’s speakers.\nAnker’s tiny Soundcore Select 4 Go is on sale starting at $22.49 (about $13 off) at Amazon, nearly matching its lowest price to date. Along with IPX67 waterproofing, the Bluetooth speaker offers up to 20 hours of battery life and can be paired with a second Select 4 Go for stereo sound.\nThe Beats Pill is on sale for around $99.95 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is $2 shy of its best price to date. The portable speaker offers noticeably improved sound over the previous model, along with support for lossless audio via USB-C. It also offers twice as much battery life, adds IP67 water and dust resistance, and includes native Find My support on both Android and iOS. Read our review.\nYou can buy the JBL Clip 5 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for around $49.95 ($30 off), which nearly matches its best price to date. The Bluetooth speaker offers a built-in carabiner so you can easily attach it to, say, a backpack, along with IP67 water resistance. The Clip 5 also offers Auracast support, so you can pair it with compatible JBL speakers for a stereo sound.\nThe Sony ULT Field 3 is available at Amazon and Walmart for around $148 ($52 off), which is its best price to date. The portable Bluetooth speaker features a dedicated ULT button to boost bass and volume, and delivers up to 24 hours of playback on a single charge. With a detachable shoulder strap and an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, it’s also a great companion for beach days. \nEarbud and headphone deals\nIf Sony’s new $449 WH-1000XM6 headphones are out of your budget, Sony’s WH-1000XM5 are on sale for around $298 (about $100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is one of their better prices to date. While they don’t fold down for easy storage, they still deliver top-tier noise cancellation, sound quality, and comfort. The new model does offer some improvements, but the upgrades aren’t significant, making the XM5 a good option at this price. Read our review.\nRight now, you can pick up Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones from Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose for $229 ($120 off), which is one of their best prices to date. They’re foldable and exceptionally comfortable — much like their predecessor, the Bose QC 45 — and they retain lengthy battery life. However, the newer headphones sport adjustable noise cancellation and custom modes, though they lack support for higher-quality Bluetooth codecs and the immersive audio mode found on the QC Ultra Headphones.\nThe Beats Studio Pro are available at Amazon in white starting at $169.99 ($170 off) or for $30 more at Best Buy and Target. The comfortable headphones offer improved noise cancellation and sound over their predecessor, with support for lossless playback over USB-C. They also work well with both iOS and Android devices, providing native support for each platform’s fast pairing and FindMy features. Read our review.\nTV and streaming device deals\nYou can also buy the latest Amazon Fire TV Cube at Amazon, Best Buy, and The Home Depot for $99.99 ($40 off), which is just $10 shy of its all-time low. The third-gen Cube functions as both a traditional Echo speaker and a Fire TV streaming device with support for Wi-Fi 6E, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and HDR. The 4K device also integrates well with Amazon Alexa for extensive hands-free voice control.\nYou can buy the standalone Amazon Fire TV Remote for $27.99 ($7 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is $3 shy of its all-time low. The remote offers a pair of programmable buttons and backlighting, along with a useful remote finder feature that lets you quickly find it using your voice or by pressing a button in the app.\nSmart home deals\nThe Blink Mini 2 has returned to its all-time low of $19.99 ($10 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. If you want to use the 1080p wired camera outside, you can also grab it with the weather-resistant power adapter for $29.98 ($20 off) at Amazon. The camera offers improved image and audio over the prior model, along with a wider 143-degree field of view and USB-C. It also retains useful features like two-way audio and motion alerts in an easy-to-mount design.\nMill is selling its Mill Food Recycler for $874, down from $999. That’s not quite on par with its all-time low of $799, but it’s still a small way to save on the high-tech trash can, which can transform kitchen scraps into a compost-like material for your garden overnight. It helps keep your kitchen from smelling bad, cuts down on food waste, and reduces the trash you generate. Read our review.\nThe latest Echo Dot is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $34.99 ($15 off), which is the best price we’ve seen this year. Placing two of the ball-shaped speakers on either side of the bed makes for surprisingly good stereo sound in a bedroom, and because each smart speaker functions as a Matter controller, you can use them to set up and control various smart home devices. Read our review.\nYou can currently buy Coway’s Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty from Amazon and Coway for $169.99, down from $229.99, which is one of the better prices we’ve seen in recent months. The small HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system that’s ideal for smaller rooms, and it automatically powers down after 30 minutes once it detects the air is clean.\nThe weatherproof Blink Outdoor 4 is 50 percent off at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, where you can pick it up for $49.99 for a limited time. The 1080p security camera includes upgrades like person detection, improved image quality, and a wider field of view than prior models, all while retaining support for motion detection, night vision, and two-way audio. It can also last up to two years on a pair of AA batteries.\nThe second-gen Ring Indoor Cam is available at Amazon and Best Buy for $34.99 ($25 off), which is $5 shy of its best price to date. The wired camera features a physical privacy cover that lets you block the camera and microphone, while its redesigned mount lets you easily adjust the camera’s angle. It also retains a number of features from its predecessor, including 1080p resolution, color night vision, and two-way audio.\nAmazon is selling a single Eero Pro 7, which can cover up to 2,000 square feet, for $549.99 ($150 off); you can also grab a pair for $799.99 ($150 off) or three units for $949.99 ($150 off). The dual-band mesh router supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 standard, offering speeds up to 3.9Gbps. Each unit also includes two 5Gbps ethernet ports and can function as a smart home hub with Matter support, a Zigbee radio, and a Thread border router.\nSmartwatch and wearable deals\nGarmin’s 41mm Venu 3S is on sale at an all-time low of $349.99 ($100 off) at Amazon and REI. The Venu 3S is our favorite Garmin smartwatch, one that combines contactless payments and other smart features with a broad swath of health tools, including period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and fall detection. It features a microphone and speaker for taking calls, too, though you’ll need your phone to take advantage of said feature since the 3S lacks built-in cellular connectivity. Read our review.\nThe 49mm Apple Watch Ultra 2 is on sale for $739 ($60 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which is one of the better prices we’ve seen this year. The rugged wearable offers the brightest display of any Apple wearable, along with the longest battery life. It also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s handy double tap feature. Read our review.\nBest Buy is selling the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 in the 40mm / Wi-Fi configuration starting at $219.99 ($80 off) with an extra Samsung band. The latest Samsung wearable is faster than its predecessor and can track your location even more accurately courtesy of its new dual-frequency GPS. It also sports a host of new features, like FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection and irregular heart rate notifications. Read our review.\nTablet deals\nOutdoor and travel deals\nThe LifeStraw Peak Series Straw — which can filter bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from water — is on sale at Amazon and REI starting at $18.69 (about $6 off), one of its best prices to date. You can use the handy outdoor gadget to drink directly from streams or rivers, yet the convenient design also allows you to attach it to bottles or connect it to gravity hose systems. The Peak Series model also features a more durable design and faster flow rate than earlier models, which is a boon for anyone in the backcountry.\nBest Buy is selling the Starlink Mini for $299.99 ($200 off). The DC-powered Mini comes with a built-in Wi-Fi 5 router that’s integrated directly into the portable satellite dish. It delivers speeds over 100Mbps and takes just minutes to set up, offering quick and easy internet access while on the go (with a qualifying internet plan starting at $50 a month). Read our review.\nYou can buy the AeroPress Original for around $31.95 ($8 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Target right now. The 3-in-1 coffee maker is one of our favorite coffee gadgets, as it easily brews 10 ounces of regular coffee or multiple espresso-style shots in about a minute. It’s also easy to clean and comes with accessories like a scoop, stirrer, and paper macro filters, so brewing up a cup of coffee on the go is even easier.\nThe Thermacell E90 Mosquito Repeller is available for $42.49 (about $7 off) at Amazon. The rechargeable device repels bugs within a 20-foot radius for up to nine hours at a time using its built-in battery. It also comes with a nine-hour cartridge, though 40-hour refills are also available.\nThe Helinox Chair Zero — a personal favorite of several Verge staffers — is on sale at REI and Amazon for around $105 ($35 off), which is its best price to date. The collapsible backpacking chair is exceptionally lightweight and easy to pack, given it weighs just a pound; it’s also built well enough to support up to 265 pounds and is both comfortable and stable, despite its portable design.\nREI is currently selling the Exped MegaMat Duo Sleeping Pad starting at $277.39, down from its normal retail price of $369.95. The 4-inch, self-inflating mattress is a favorite of ours for camping thanks to its extra-wide design, along with its open-cell polyurethane foam and generous padding, the latter of which is designed to keep you warm and comfortable when temperatures begin to dip. It also makes for a great air mattress for guests, regardless of where you put it.\nThe Half Dome 2 Tent is on sale at REI with a footprint for $209.29 ($90 off), which is one of the best prices we’ve seen on the REI-branded tent. The inexpensive three-season offering is easy to set up and offers plenty of space for two people, with built-in pockets for organizing gear and two large doors that roll up. It’s certainly not the lightest offering you can buy, but at this price, it’s an easy recommendation for first-time backpackers and anyone looking for a solid tent for car camping.\nOther miscellaneous deals\nDell’s 16 Plus Windows laptop that released earlier this year is seeing steep discounts when you buy directly through Dell itself. We’re particularly impressed with the discount on the model that has a 2,560 x 1,600 resolution screen (instead of FHD+ in the base configuration), 16GB of RAM, Intel’s Core Ultra 7 256V processor, and 1TB of NVMe storage for $799.99 (normally $1,149.99).\nBelkin’s older MagSafe 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand is down to $73.99 ($17 off) at Amazon, which is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen. It delivers up to 15W of power to MagSafe-compatible iPhones, with a pad that can also charge a pair of AirPods or a second Qi-enabled device, all while propping up your phone at a convenient viewing angle.\nYou can pick up PowerA’s Enhanced Wireless Controller starting at $35.62 ($25 off) at Amazon, which is $3 shy of its best price to date. A number of designs are on sale, too, ranging from an Animal Crossing-inspired option to Mario-themed ones. Overall, the colorful gamepad is a good budget model for the Nintendo Switch, complete with support for Bluetooth, remappable buttons, and motion controls.\nIf the mere prospect of summer already has you sweating, Jisulife’s adorable handheld fan is on sale at Amazon in an assortment of colors starting at $15.29 (about $3 off), nearly matching its all-time low. Jisulife’s bag-friendly option is a pretty no-frills affair, though it does pack a built-in stand and can charge via USB-C; it also doubles as a 4,800mAh battery pack, as if its base functionality and the adorable bear ears weren’t enough.\nThe Slice Auto-Retractable Box Cutter is on sale for $14.60 (about $5 off) at Amazon, which is its best price so far this year. The ceramic blade automatically retracts, making it a safe tool for opening packages around the house or office.\nThe Goliath Power Saber is on sale at Amazon for $13.50 (about $37 off), its lowest price to date. The so-called “power saber” isn’t an official Star Wars toy, sadly, but it’s a fun light-up blade that can automatically extend and retract; it will also collapse when you actually press it against something, meaning it’s a relatively safe pick for kids.\nUpdate, May 26th: Adjusted pricing / availability, removed expired discounts, and added several new deals, including those for the fifth-gen Echo Dot and the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.","summary":"Memorial Day weekend isn’t just for barbecues and beach trips — it’s also a chance to score some of the best tech deals you’ll find all season.
