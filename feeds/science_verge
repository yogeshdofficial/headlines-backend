Speakers on a stage led prayers and chants: “Freedom now” and “sí se puede.” In the shadow of LA’s city hall, participants held up signs reading “ICE out of LA”, “Keep LA families together”, “Educación no deportación.” \nWhen the morning rally came to a close and more demonstrators arrived, a march began through downtown, headed toward the detention center in Los Angeles. Organizers on microphones shouted “Peaceful protesting, no tagging!” as youth with hoodies pulled tight around their faces spray painted “fuck ICE” on buildings lining the streets. \n“Join us! You think Elon Musk gives a fuck?” a blond woman wearing a pink bandana yelled at a group of officers, her voice cracking.\nA band cruising alongside on an open flatbed truck serenaded dancing crowds singing along in Spanish, FUCK ICE on the band leader’s neon yellow shirt. Stopping at Los Angeles Plaza Park, the march turned into an impromptu dance party with demonstrators. \nTensions heightened a few blocks down as demonstrators marched closer to the detention center. Outside of the federal building behind the detention center, the California National Guard was lined up alongside police in front of rows of windows tagged with “Fuck Trump.” Demonstrators faced them, blocking the street with cars, motorcycles, and their bodies, chanting iterations of  the same phrase. They called for the release of detainees — “Bring them home!” \nOn the rooftop of a mall across the street, two young teens or preteens dropped their bicycles carrying Mexican and American flags to sit and watch and dangle their legs off the ledge.  \nTrump has targeted Los Angeles for a shock-and-awe military campaign; as the march continued, news broke that hundreds of Marines were being deployed to guard federal property. He’s painted protesters as invaders and “insurrectionists.” But at Monday’s actions, protesters The Verge spoke with at Grand Park were fighting for a future in the US. \nAs some protesters and other members of the media started donning gas masks in the late afternoon heat, it was time for us to leave.\n“David Huerta is a mentor. He’s a dear friend. He’s someone that I have worked with for many years, someone that I worked with very closely. And I’m on the phone with him and talking to him every single day … I could only imagine if the highest ranking Latino leader in the labor movement was treated that way — What kind of treatment do immigrant workers face on the day at work every day? And it takes all of this to free a known leader who has tremendous political support, community support, and we still can’t get him free. What really is going on to regular folks, regular immigrants who don’t have access to all of this. So I know that David would be saying today that this is not about him. This is about workers and he’s absolutely right.” —Christian Ramirez, political director, at SEIU, United Service Workers West\n“I had a higher education because of all the sacrifices my family took to be here. As a daughter of first generation immigrants, I really understood that. I had a parent also taken away by ICE when I was in middle school, and that was incredibly impactful at such a pivotal time of your life to get stripped away from the one thing that sometimes is the only thing that is secure in your life. It’s completely shattering and I can only imagine what some families are going through right now. So I’m here for that.” —A participant with Contra-Tiempo Artivist Theater who was granted anonymity to protect their family\n“Our students are afraid. Our communities are under attack, and they have a lot of questions, you know. And as we’re approaching summer break, I’m a little afraid because they won’t have the classroom. We don’t have that safe space to be … what I find joy in is reminding them that the next presidential election, they’ll be voters. They’re in the ninth grade now.  They’re 14. When we vote for our next president, they’ll be voters. So they can remember how they feel today and use their voices in the right way to be informed constituents when they cast their votes.” —Gina Gray, a high school English teacher with United Teachers Los Angeles.\n“We’ve certainly seen our fair share of emergencies here in Los Angeles already in 2025. What we know is that chain of command is very important, and the fact that our president would disregard proper chain of command in terms of how we deploy our safety resources, just shows that this is not about safety. This is about power and control, and it is absolutely unacceptable … We are opposing this fascist attack on our democracy, and we have a right to do that.” —LA County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath","summary":"On Monday after a weekend of demonstrations, hundreds of people flocked to Downtown Los Angeles for another round — to support loved ones who’ve been detained during recent immigration protests or&#160;ICE raids, and to face off with National Guard troops deployed by President Donald Trump.

During the event, the company showed off the sleek design refresh coming to its operating systems, as well as a mix of new features for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, and more.\nHere’s a roundup of some of the most exciting changes Apple announced during the keynote — you can watch our edited version that cuts it down to under thirty minutes right here.\nApple’s operating systems are now named by year\nAs predicted, Apple has given each of its operating systems new version numbers that now align with the year after their release, rather than the version number. The new names are iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. They’ll be coming out in late 2025, but still, it’s easier to remember that than iOS 19, watchOS 12, and macOS 16.\nThe operating systems are available as developer betas starting today and will be available to all users this fall.\nLiquid Glass design updates across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and more\nApple is revamping the design across its operating systems. Now they will have a new Liquid Glass theme that adds more transparency to buttons, switches, sliders, text, and media controls throughout their interfaces.\nThe date, time, notification previews on iOS 26’s lockscreen will also adopt the new look, allowing you to get a clear view of your wallpaper behind all the text.\nNew looks for the Camera, Safari, and Phone apps\nAs part of its broader redesign, Apple revealed revamps for some of its core apps in iOS 26. Now, webpages in Safari will take up your entire screen. The Camera app also has a simplified layout that shows you two main options — photo and video — and you can swipe on the tool bar to reveal other modes, such as Slow-Mo and Cinematic.\nThe Phone app is getting an upgrade, as well, as it will now have a layout that combines favorites, recents, and voicemails into one panel, while calls, contacts, and keypad remain on the bottom of the app.\niPadOS 26 will come with better windowing features\nApple is bringing a major update to iPadOS 26 that should make multitasking easier. New windowing capabilities will let you resize app windows, place them around your display, and open more windows at once. It’s also adding a more precise mouse pointer and a new menu bar, allowing you to swipe down on an app to view various options and commands. It all looks a lot more Mac-like.\niPadOS 26 is also getting a version of the Mac’s Preview app to view and annotate image and files.\nMessages gets custom backgrounds and new group chat features\nApple is updating Messages to let you change the background of your chats and create polls in group conversations. Some other updates include typing indicators for group chats and the ability to screen messages from unknown senders, which will appear in a separate folder instead of your main list.\nApple reveals a new hub for games\nApple revealed a new Games app that will let you access all of your Apple Arcade games and discover new ones from a single spot. You can check out the Library tab to view the games you’ve downloaded from the App Store, as well as use the Play Together option to challenge friends.\nmacOS Tahoe 26 makes Spotlight more useful\nThe next macOS software update will introduce an upgrade to Spotlight that will make your search results more relevant with personalization and filtering options to help you search for specific files, folders, apps, and messages. It also adds the ability to take actions like sending an email or creating a note.\nApple is also bringing the Phone and the newly announced Games app to macOS 26, along with support for the iPhone’s Live Activities.\nThe Vision Pro adds PSVR2 controller support\nThe Apple Vision Pro will support PlayStation’s VR2 Sense controllers in visionOS 26, which will let you play a wider variety of virtual-reality games. It’s also adding a new scrolling feature that lets users navigate apps by looking up or down, in addition to spatial widgets that integrate “seamlessly into a user’s space and reappearing every time they put on Apple Vision Pro.”\nApple Intelligence can search what’s on your screen\nThere’s a new Apple Intelligence feature coming to iOS 26 that lets you use the same buttons you would to take a screenshot to call upon the AI assistant. From there, you can ask additional questions about what you’re seeing on your screen with ChatGPT or search for a particular object on Google or Etsy to find similar images.\nwatchOS 26 adds a new “wrist flick” gesture\nAlong with the Liquid Glass design language, Apple is bringing a new “wrist flick” gesture to watchOS 26 that you can use to dismiss notifications. The Apple Watch will have a new AI-powered “Workout Buddy,” as well, which will generate personalized advice and encouragement.\nLive Translation is coming to calls and text messages\nApple is building AI-powered live translation into the Messages, FaceTime, and Phone apps. You can use the integration to automatically translate texts in the Messages app, while you’ll hear speech translated aloud on the Phone app. In FaceTime, Apple will display translated live captions while you listen to your conversation partner.\nAirPods will soon offer new camera controls\nApple previewed an update that will let users take a photo with their iPhone or iPad by tapping the stem of their AirPods. It’s also working on a new feature that lets users record “studio-quality” vocals in noisy areas with voice isolation. The features will come to the AirPods 4, AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation, and AirPods Pro 2.\nApple opens its AI models to developers\nThough Apple’s keynote was a bit light on AI news, the company announced that it will let third-party app developers access the on-device large language model used by Apple Intelligence, allowing them to create tools of their own.","summary":"Apple packed a bunch of major updates into its annual Worldwide Developer Conference keynote.
