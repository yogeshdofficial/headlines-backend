But interim CEO Tom Conrad has shown that he’s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place today than just a few months ago, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It’s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction — and I took Sonos’ decision to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/628297/sonos-pinewood-streaming-box-canceled\">cancel its video player</a> as a promising sign of renewed focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company’s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don’t match — at least not without hassle. Most of the time, I’m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I’m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company’s recent speakers, it’s possible to do the same thing and <a href=\"https://support.sonos.com/en-us/article/share-bluetooth-audio-with-your-sonos-system\">spread that music across your entire Sonos system</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-you-should-trust-my-sonos-recommendations\"><strong>Why you should trust my Sonos recommendations</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at <em>The Verge</em>. This has included reporting on the company’s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I’m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great — or just another also-ran product.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I wouldn’t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here. But keep in mind that tariffs might eventually lead to price increases for some of these products. Putting the software misstep aside, this company makes some genuinely excellent hardware, so if you don’t want to risk paying more, now might be the time to buy. And if you’re wondering which are the true standouts, I’ve got you covered.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Best overall: Sonos Five</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Sonos-Five-Products-Grid-Image.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087CC4QH4/\"> $549 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/five/\"> $549 at <strong>Sonos</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sonos-five-high-fidelity-wireless-speaker-white/6411134.p\"> $549.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Best to start with: Sonos Era 100</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24530056/DSCF0433.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of the Sonos Era 100 on a kitchen counter beside a toaster and iPad.\" /></figure>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Era-100-Wireless-Speaker/dp/B0BW34LCB8/\"> $199 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sonos-era-100-wifi-and-bluetooth-smart-speaker-each-black/6535191.p?\"> $199 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/era-100/\"> $199 at <strong>Sonos</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-sonos-speaker-to-start-with\">The best Sonos speaker to start with</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sonos Era 100</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24530090/DSCF0435.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of the Sonos Era 100 speaker in a kitchen setting beside an iPad and toaster.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Improved sound (now in stereo)</li><li>Bluetooth and line-in support</li><li>Privacy-conscious microphone controls</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No more Google Assistant</li><li>Rejiggered controls have a learning curve</li><li>Line-in requires USB-C dongle</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Era-100-Wireless-Speaker/dp/B0BW34LCB8/\"> $199 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sonos-era-100-wifi-and-bluetooth-smart-speaker-each-black/6535191.p?\"> $199 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/era-100\"> $199 at <strong>Sonos</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker’s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (with <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sonos-line-in-adapter\">a separate dongle</a>). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, <em>finally</em>, dedicated track controls.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24530057/DSCF0440.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Era 100’s built-in mics let you change the music when the physical controls are out of reach.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos recently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/642013/sonos-era-100-ray-price-drop\">dropped the Era 100’s price to $199</a>, which is more than fair for what you’re getting.

From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, Echo Studio, Nest Audio, and other mass market speakers — both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren’t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s nothing “smart” about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you’re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion — especially if you spring for a stereo pair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-portable-sonos-speaker\">The best portable Sonos speaker</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sonos Move 2</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24920161/DSCF2979.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of the Sonos Move 2 portable speaker.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Improved stereo sound</li><li>Much longer battery life</li><li>Supports line-in playback</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No more Google Assistant</li><li>Can’t be used as a speakerphone</li><li>Hefty for a portable speaker</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGGYYK2D/\"> $449 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sonos-move-2-portable-durable-smart-speaker-each-black/6557775.p\"> $449 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/move-2\"> <strike>$449</strike> $44 at <strong>Sonos</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos’ much smaller Roam 2. It’s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There’s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. Like the Era 100, it has a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24929138/DSCF2948_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Move 2 is both water-resistant and drop-resistant, so it’s built for handling your outdoor parties.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Move’s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you’ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can’t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You’ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don’t drop it into a pool.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I’m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it’s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-full-sonos-move-2-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23877274/sonos-move-2-review\">Read our full Sonos Move 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-sonos-soundbar-for-home-theater-enthusiasts\">The best Sonos soundbar for home theater enthusiasts</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sonos Arc Ultra</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Arc Ultra surpasses the original Arc soundbar with more immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound, much better bass, and the ability to play music over Bluetooth.</div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25783563/DSC_1403.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"A photo of the Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar in front of a television on a stand.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>More immersive sound than original Arc</li><li>Bass gains are substantial enough to make this a viable standalone option</li><li>Now supports Bluetooth audio</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Sonos app remains buggy for some</li><li>Play:1 and Play:3 no longer supported as surrounds</li><li>Still no DTS:X</li><li>Full surround setup skyrockets the cost</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Ultra-Soundbar-Dolby-Control/dp/B0DFK28LBB\"> $999 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-black/6597167.p\"> $999 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/arc-ultra\"> $999 at <strong>Sonos</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Introduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That’s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos’ new SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that’s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25783564/DSC_1412.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;That little indent makes it easier to find the Arc Ultra’s volume contrls.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that’s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it’s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-full-review-of-the-sonos-arc-ultra\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24315195/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-more-bass\">Read our full review of the Sonos Arc Ultra</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-sonos-soundbar-for-smaller-rooms\">The best Sonos soundbar for smaller rooms</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sonos Beam (Gen 2)</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Beam isn&#8217;t as powerful as the Sonos Arc, nor can it match the flagship soundbar&#8217;s Dolby Atmos immersion bubble.

If you’re in a smaller space or don’t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra’s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you’ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-my-full-sonos-beam-gen-2-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22701137/sonos-beam-gen-2-atmos-soundbar-review-specs\">Read our full Sonos Beam (Gen 2) review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-sonos-subwoofer-for-most-people\">The best Sonos subwoofer for most people</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Sonos Sub Mini</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24063719/SubMiniLede.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"An image of the Sonos Sub Mini pictured on the floor with a TV stand and various components behind it.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Sleek, unique design</li><li>Good bass presence for its size</li><li>Easy setup process</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Not suitable for large living rooms</li><li>Still not cheap</li><li>Trueplay tuning only works on iOS</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BGJV72YM/\"> $429 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sonos-sub-mini-dual-6-wifi-subwoofer-black/6520132.p?\"> $429 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub-mini-black\"> $429 at <strong>Sonos</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the same vein, unless you’re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $429 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows.

But interim CEO Tom Conrad has shown that he’s determined to get back on track and revitalize Sonos as the leading whole-home audio brand. The contentious mobile app is in a much better place today than just a few months ago, though some customers still encounter bugs and the frustration of speakers randomly vanishing from their system. It’s not all roses, but the situation is moving in the right direction — and I took Sonos’ decision to cancel its video player as a promising sign of renewed focus. \nI’m not about to sell any of my Sonos gear. For one, the company’s whole-home platform offers conveniences that competitors don’t match — at least not without hassle. Most of the time, I’m streaming from Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube Music. But if I’m watching a sports game on my TV, I can pipe the audio from my Sonos soundbar to a speaker in a different room to follow the action. Playing something over Bluetooth? With most of the company’s recent speakers, it’s possible to do the same thing and spread that music across your entire Sonos system.\nWhy you should trust my Sonos recommendations\nI’ve covered Sonos extensively for several years at The Verge. This has included reporting on the company’s latest news, reviewing a lengthy list of Sonos products, and bringing attention to the app fiasco, which eventually led to the ouster of former CEO Patrick Spence. Audio and home theater are two of my primary focus areas in product reviews, so I’m well-versed when it comes to determining whether a speaker or soundbar is great — or just another also-ran product.\nI wouldn’t fault anyone for waiting to see where Sonos and its app go from here. But keep in mind that tariffs might eventually lead to price increases for some of these products. Putting the software misstep aside, this company makes some genuinely excellent hardware, so if you don’t want to risk paying more, now might be the time to buy. And if you’re wondering which are the true standouts, I’ve got you covered.\nFeatured in this article\nBest overall: Sonos Five\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 at Amazon\n $549 at Sonos\n $549.99 at Best Buy\n\nBest to start with: Sonos Era 100\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199 at Amazon\n $199 at Best Buy\n $199 at Sonos\n\nThe best Sonos speaker to start with\nSonos Era 100\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved sound (now in stereo)\nBluetooth and line-in support\nPrivacy-conscious microphone controls\n\nNo more Google Assistant\nRejiggered controls have a learning curve\nLine-in requires USB-C dongle\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199 at Amazon\n $199 at Best Buy\n $199 at Sonos\n\nIf you’re looking for a decent-sounding, compact speaker to put in the kitchen, office, or really anywhere in your home, the Era 100 is your best option. Sonos improved upon this speaker’s predecessors, the Play:1 and Sonos One, by upgrading to stereo drivers for richer, wider audio. Bluetooth playback is now supported, along with line-in audio (with a separate dongle). And the Era 100 also has reworked physical controls, including a volume bar you can slide your finger across and, finally, dedicated track controls. \nThe speaker has an elegant design, and you can use hands-free voice controls to summon Amazon Alexa or Sonos Voice Control to skip tracks or switch to a different playlist. Sonos recently dropped the Era 100’s price to $199, which is more than fair for what you’re getting. I’d buy now and avoid risking the cost going up again, thanks to tariffs.\nRead our full Sonos Era 100 review.\nThe best overall Sonos speaker\nSonos Five\n\n\n\nProsCons\n\n\nPowerful audio with impressive stereo separation\nCan crank loud without distorting\nRegular 3.5mm line-in: no adapter required\n\nLacks smart speaker functionality\nEasily collects dust\nYou’ll end up wanting two, which gets very expensive\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $549 at Amazon\n $549 at Sonos\n $549.99 at Best Buy\n\nThe Sonos Five isn’t just Sonos’ best-sounding speaker; it’s at the top of the pack compared to all competitors. From an audio quality perspective, it beats the HomePod, Echo Studio, Nest Audio, and other mass market speakers — both those that are smart and not. Can you find better hi-fi bookshelf speakers? Absolutely, but those aren’t natively tied into music services like Sonos gear is. The Five is a hefty unit and takes up a decent amount of desk space. But once you throw some music on, its powerful stereo output is enough to handle any dinner party or weekend get-together. \nThere’s nothing “smart” about the Five. It lacks microphones and voice assistant functionality. But that simplicity is appealing in its own right: you’re getting a damn good speaker that ties into the Sonos platform. The Five also features a 3.5mm aux input, making it a good turntable companion — especially if you spring for a stereo pair. \nThe best portable Sonos speaker\nSonos Move 2\n\n\nScore: 9\n\nProsCons\n\n\nImproved stereo sound\nMuch longer battery life\nSupports line-in playback\n\nNo more Google Assistant\nCan’t be used as a speakerphone\nHefty for a portable speaker\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $449 at Amazon\n $449 at Best Buy\n $449 $44 at Sonos\n\nWhen it comes to portable speakers, the Move 2 is in a whole different league than Sonos’ much smaller Roam 2. It’s bigger and heavier, but a built-in handle makes it easier to lug the Move 2 around your home or out to the backyard. There’s no comparison between the two when it comes to audio: the Move 2 smokes the far more compact Roam 2. Like the Era 100, it has a stereo driver arrangement, whereas the Roam mixes everything down to mono and sounds more muffled.\nThe Move’s larger size gives it a clear advantage in terms of bass punch, and aside from playing music wirelessly, you’ve got the option of plugging in other devices over USB-C for line-in audio. I also continue to appreciate that the battery in the Move 2 is user-replaceable, which can’t be said of many Bluetooth speakers. You’ll be able to keep enjoying your investment for long, long into the future. And with a dust / water resistance rating of IP56, it can handle rain and splashes of water without problems; just don’t drop it into a pool.\nI prefer the Move 2 over traditional portable speakers since, at least whenever I’m home, the Sonos lets me play music over Wi-Fi at a higher fidelity than Bluetooth can offer. Plus, the Move 2 also supports Apple AirPlay and Spotify Connect, so it’s easy to just skip the Sonos app altogether if you wish.\nRead our full Sonos Move 2 review.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for home theater enthusiasts\nSonos Arc Ultra\nThe Arc Ultra surpasses the original Arc soundbar with more immersive Dolby Atmos surround sound, much better bass, and the ability to play music over Bluetooth.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nMore immersive sound than original Arc\nBass gains are substantial enough to make this a viable standalone option\nNow supports Bluetooth audio\n\nSonos app remains buggy for some\nPlay:1 and Play:3 no longer supported as surrounds\nStill no DTS:X\nFull surround setup skyrockets the cost\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 at Amazon\n $999 at Best Buy\n $999 at Sonos\n\nIntroduced in late 2024, the Arc Ultra improves on the original Arc with significantly more powerful bass response. That’s largely thanks to the inclusion of Sonos’ new SoundMotion technology, which manages to get a better low-end wallop from a soundbar that’s not much larger than the model it replaces. This means some buyers can get away with buying the Arc Ultra on its own without adding a subwoofer. \nThe Arc Ultra delivers Dolby Atmos surround sound that’s more convincing and immersive than any other Sonos soundbar to date, and it’s up there with the very best you can find from a single-enclosure speaker. Vocal clarity has also improved substantially thanks to better center channel performance. Another upgrade over the first Arc is the addition of Bluetooth audio support.\nRead our full review of the Sonos Arc Ultra.\nThe best Sonos soundbar for smaller rooms\nSonos Beam (Gen 2)\nThe Beam isn’t as powerful as the Sonos Arc, nor can it match the flagship soundbar’s Dolby Atmos immersion bubble. But you still get room-filling surround sound for less money — and the Beam ties into the Sonos ecosystem for added convenience.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nWider, more expansive sound\nHDMI eARC brings better performance\nSleeker design than first Beam\n\nNo up-facing Atmos speakers\nDoesn’t have automatic Trueplay\nSame acoustic architecture as prior model\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $499 $443 at Amazon\n $499 at Best Buy\n $499 at Sonos\n\nThere are plenty of scenarios and TV rooms where the Arc Ultra might be too powerful. If you’re in a smaller space or don’t need the absolute best surround sound, the Beam (Gen 2) starts to make more sense. It still has Atmos, but the effect is virtualized since the Beam lacks the Arc Ultra’s upward-firing speakers. Even so, the home theater experience you’ll get from the Beam will blow away any speakers built into a TV. \nRead our full Sonos Beam (Gen 2) review.\nThe best Sonos subwoofer for most people\nSonos Sub Mini\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nSleek, unique design\nGood bass presence for its size\nEasy setup process\n\nNot suitable for large living rooms\nStill not cheap\nTrueplay tuning only works on iOS\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 at Amazon\n $429 at Best Buy\n $429 at Sonos\n\nIn the same vein, unless you’re hell bent on rumbling your walls, the $429 Sub Mini subwoofer is more than enough for layering some extra oomph and growl onto Hollywood blockbusters and your favorite TV shows. The $799 Sub 4 is Sonos’ flagship subwoofer, but plenty of people have saved hundreds of dollars by pairing the Sub Mini with any of the company’s soundbars — and they’ve been ecstatic with the results. \nAs its name suggests, the Sub Mini is more compact than the Sub 4, which makes it easier to find an inconspicuous spot to place it. Even if you’re the type to do a sub crawl and put it somewhere in plain sight, I’d argue it looks more stylish than the blocky Sub 4. \nRead my full Sonos Sub Mini review.\nThe best budget Sonos speaker\nIkea Symfonisk Bookshelf Speaker (Gen 2)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAffordable way into Sonos ecosystem\nCan be mounted as a shelf\nSatisfactory sound for the size\nGood option for Sonos surround sound\n\nNo built-in mic for voice assistants\nYou’ll want two for the best audio experience\nNo 3.5mm aux input\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $179.99 at Ikea\n\nSonos and Ikea might be winding down their partnership, but that doesn’t mean you should sleep on the existing Symfonisk products before they’re completely phased out.

With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.</p>\n\n<p>Yet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets.

Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.</p>\n\n<p>However, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24724410/236588_Fujifilm_Instax_Mini_12_SVasani_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5749128919861,100,88.850174216028\" alt=\"A closeup of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 camera and its lens structure surrounded by photos it printed in the background.\" title=\"A closeup of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 camera and its lens structure surrounded by photos it printed in the background.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 features a new lens structure that’s fun and more intuitive to play with.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>You can also now zoom in a little easier thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter the Close-Up Mode in lieu of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new&nbsp;“Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).</p>\n\n<p>The Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it also doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fSDErJ\">Best premium instant camera</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23350933/BFARSACE_220328_5108_1.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"The Instax Mini Evo being held up with a hand against a dark background with cameras that are out of focus.\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 8</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Great use of dials and buttons</li><li>Lots of printing flexibility</li><li>Good battery life</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Internal storage is limited</li><li>Micro USB port is annoying</li><li>No viewfinder</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B09M4DKBQ9/\"> $199.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1774544-REG/fujifilm_instax_mini_evo_black.html\"> $199.95 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/instax-mini-evo-instant-film-camera-black/-/A-85725124\"> $199.99 at <strong>Target</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type: </strong>Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately)</em> <em>/ <strong>Film size:</strong> 2 x 3-inches /</em></em> <em><em><strong>Weight: </strong>285 grams<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Charging method: </strong>USB-C (on newer models) /<strong> Companion app: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Other features:</strong> LCD screen, smartphone printing</em></em></p>\n\n<p>One of Fujifilm’s newest instant cameras, the Instax Mini Evo, was a favorite of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22989946/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-instant-camera-review-test-photography\">my former colleague Becca Farcase</a> — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a brown version and <a href=\"https://instax.com/mini_evo/en/90th_anniversary/\">limited edition models in silver and gold</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to balk at its $199 price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23350937/BFARSACE_220328_5108_3.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table sideways with the large LCD screen and back mostly in view.\" title=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table sideways with the large LCD screen and back mostly in view.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Instax Mini Evo comes with a large LCD screen that doubles as a viewfinder and allows you to choose which photos to print.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Becca Farsace / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Becca Farsace / The Verge\" />\n<p>Unlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed out, which was helpful given neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 are particularly great at capturing dark environments.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23601818/svasani_220525_5251_0009.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table surrounded by photos it’s produced.\" title=\"The Instax Mini Evo resting on a table surrounded by photos it’s produced.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Being able to adjust the brightness of the prints helped me capture night photos and a low-light immersive exhibit a little more clearly and realistically, which is a feature the Instax Mini 12 doesn’t offer.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>Of course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add some filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps available for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely on internal storage solely, you can only take 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"di2Ydc\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22989946/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-instant-camera-review-test-photography\"><strong>Read our Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo review</strong></a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"aLU8Kl\">The best instant camera for social occasions</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23611271/svasani_KodakMiniRetro3cropped.jpb.png?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 6</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Lets you print photos from your phone</li><li>Entertaining companion app</li><li>Comes with film</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>So-so image quality </li><li>Unable to store images</li><li>Not as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Compatible-Bluetooth-Technology-Laminated/dp/B084MKYMXC/?th=1\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $139.99 at <strong>Amazon (with 8 sheets)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://kodakphotoprinter.com/products/best-instant-camera-kodak-mini-shot-3-retro\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $149.99 at <strong>Kodak (with 8 sheets)</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/KODAK-Mini-Shot-3-Retro-4PASS-2-in-1-Instant-Camera-and-Photo-Printer-3x3-inches-8-Sheets-Yellow/373093173\"> <strike>$169.99</strike> $149.99 at <strong>Walmart (with 8 sheets)</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type: </strong>Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / <strong>Film size: </strong>3 x 3-inch square prints / <strong>Weight: </strong>467 grams / <strong>Charging method: </strong>Micro USB /<strong> Companion app: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/<strong> Other features:</strong> LCD screen, smartphone printing</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Whereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app allows you to apply frames, stickers, filters, and a plethora of customization options to photos, making the camera great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature within the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making this a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23601821/svasani_220525_5251_0012.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"The yellow and black Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro being held up sideways with a hand and a bush as the background.\" title=\"The yellow and black Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro being held up sideways with a hand and a bush as the background.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;With its feature-rich app, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro is more modern than retro.

It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of a film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; <a href=\"https://shop.kodakphotoprinter.com/products/kodak-photo-printer-mini-3-retro-film-cartridge-refill-pack\">you can currently pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99</a>, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than both Fujifilm’s and Polaroid’s.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23601823/svasani_220525_5251_0014.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"Two photos produced by the Kodak Mini Shot 3 that are relatively true-to-life but too oversaturated with a pink tint.\" title=\"Two photos produced by the Kodak Mini Shot 3 that are relatively true-to-life but too oversaturated with a pink tint.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Kodak Mini Shot 3 aren’t particularly sharp and can have an excessive pink tint.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>However, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint that can interfere with quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"W8F3oS\">The best instant camera for retro fans</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Polaroid Now Plus (second-gen)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24984865/236831_best_instant_cameras_you_can_buy_right_now_SVasani_0003.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Handsome, retro design</li><li>Prints dreamy, vintage-style photos </li><li>Several creative modes</li><li>USB-C</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Struggles in low light</li><li>Film takes up to 15 minutes to develop</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Generation-Bluetooth-Connected-Controlled/dp/B0BVNPW1PX/\"> <strike>$149.99</strike> $114.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1784768-REG/polaroid_polaroid_now_2nd_generation.html/\"> <strike>$149.99</strike> $114.99 at <strong>B&amp;H Photo</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/polaroid-now-instant-film-camera-generation-2-white/6536336.p\"> $149.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type:</strong> Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / <strong>Film size:</strong> 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / <strong>Weight:</strong> 451.5 grams / <strong>Charging method:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Companion app:</strong> Yes / <strong>Other features: </strong>Lens filter kit, film counter</em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the camera for you. Compared to the other instant cameras on this list, it most closely resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 with its classic, retro-inspired design. Meanwhile, its square I-Type film prints and iconic Polaroid-style frame give photos a more authentically vintage look.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus comes with a suite of modern features, including support for USB-C charging. It also offers Bluetooth and a companion app that boasts several creative modes, allowing greater photographic control. These include a remote shutter, a self-timer, and the “Polaroid Lab,” which lets you adjust the exposure and various color settings. The app also features a handful of shooting modes — including a manual option — and the camera comes with a set of five colored lenses you can snap onto the front. These were enjoyable to play with and allowed for more artistic expression.</p>\n\n<p>If there’s one thing the Polaroid Now Plus isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given how heavy, large, and awkwardly sized it is, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Plus, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you have to ensure it’s not exposed to light while developing. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24984866/236831_best_instant_cameras_you_can_buy_right_now_SVasani_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5637254901961,100,88.872549019608\" alt=\"Six photos produced by the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus.\" title=\"Six photos produced by the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The photos I took with the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus weren’t that true to life, but they did give off an old-school vibe that I found charming.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>If you’re looking for an instant camera that can easily print a good, clear photo without much effort on your part, this is not the camera for you. Of all the cameras on this list, the latest Polaroid Now Plus struggles with low-light environments the most. I could barely see images I took indoors, and I could only get the clearest shots when the light was directly behind me during the day — specifically, in the morning. Even these images weren’t as clear in comparison to Instax film, and both contrast and color saturation levels tend to be quite low.</p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, this gave my pictures more of a dreamy vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming. Given all these issues, I found it was easy to waste film, which proved expensive. After all, you only get eight I-Type sheets <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckOmBppUA3u?u1=verge\">for $16.99</a>, and that’s in addition to forking out $149.99 for the camera.</p>\n\n<p>Truth be told, however, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind the price, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the perfect camera for you.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24984863/236831_best_instant_cameras_you_can_buy_right_now_SVasani_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"A closeup of a green second-gen Polaroid Now Plus held up against a brown background.\" title=\"A closeup of a green second-gen Polaroid Now Plus held up against a brown background.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is a good combination of old-school and modern but was way too big for me to comfortably hold with just one hand.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All that being said, it’s worth pointing out that Polaroid recently launched the <a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\">$139.99 Now Plus Generation 3</a>.

The new camera seems like it’s largely an iterative update, with a built-in tripod and four new colors to choose from instead of just three. It should also offer brighter, more accurate lighting in high-contrast scenes and improved depth perception, courtesy of upgrades to the ranging sensor, light meter position, and autofocus.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"yddqEQ\">The best instant camera for portability</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Polaroid Go (second-gen)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25382125/247082_Polaroid_Go_2_SVasani_0001.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Tiny and lightweight</li><li>Prints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid Now Plus</li><li>USB-C</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Struggles in low light</li><li>Film takes up to 15 minutes to develop</li><li>No Bluetooth support or companion app</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Go-Generation-Instant-Included/dp/B0CG7P9KTH/\"> <strike>$89.99</strike> $67.6 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/go-polaroid-camera\"> $89.99 at <strong>Polaroid</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p><em><em><strong>Film type:</strong> Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) /<strong> Film size: </strong>2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / <strong>Weight:</strong> 239 grams / <strong>Charging method:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Companion app:</strong> No / <strong>Other features: </strong>Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Whereas the Polaroid Now Plus is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It easily fits into the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it easily the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.</p>\n\n<p>Weighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Now Plus and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.</p>\n\n<p><strong>At $89.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, even with its recent $10 price increase</strong>. Its film also costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about<a href=\"https://us.polaroid.com/products/color-go-instant-film\"> $19.99 for a 16-sheet pack</a>). The camera also sports a small number of upgrades over the last-gen model despite retailing for less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to spend money on AA batteries.</p>\n\n<p>Polaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference from one generation to the next. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go — like the Now Plus — produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Now Plus.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25382128/247082_Polaroid_Go_2_SVasani_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Polaroid Go produces charming photos but with a cooler tone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>Unlike the Now Plus, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25382127/247082_Polaroid_Go_2_SVasani_0003.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Polaroid Go is easy to hold with one hand.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Sheena Vasani / The Verge\" />\n<p>That said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that provides a more traditional instant film experience — one they can take advantage of just about anywhere for half the price of the Polaroid Now Plus.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SYcVqE\">Other instant cameras to consider</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kodak-smile-plus\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KODAK-Effect-Changing-Sticky-Backed-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0CQMLV5S6/\">Kodak Smile Plus</a></h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/KODAK-Effect-Changing-Sticky-Backed-Technology-Compatible/dp/B0CQMLV5S6/\">Kodak Smile Plus</a> is another hybrid instant camera you can use to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $99.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers. </p>\n\n<p>However, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app that’s similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software is not as snappy or feature-rich, it still allows you to add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it can often be found for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pJsALN\"><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1789993-REG/leica_19190_sofort_2_hybrid_instant.html\">Leica Sofort 2</a></h3>\n\n<p>From photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23902287/leica-sofort-2-instant-film-camera\">Leica’s Sofort 2</a> is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.</p>\n\n<p>The drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s hard to recommend at $389 since most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The user interface is easier to navigate on the Leica, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also like that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dmcgAS\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B0CXZQGL2D/\">Instax Mini 99</a></h3>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for an analog instant camera that’s more advanced, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. <strong>At <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-Instax-Mini-Instant-Camera/dp/B0CXZQGL2D/\">$169 ($30 off)</a>, </strong>Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click camera given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket and an aluminum extension column, as well as a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur while capturing fast-moving subjects.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12 and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera and not a hybrid like the $199.99 Mini Evo, meaning you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The new model also isn’t as simple to use as the Mini 12, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Ugwaku\"><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1775648-REG/fujifilm_16802814_instax_square_sq40.html\">Instax Square SQ1</a></h3>\n\n<p>While it didn’t make the cut, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21431103/fujifilm-instax-square-sq1-instant-camera-review-price-specs-features\">Instax Square SQ1</a> is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Instax Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and comes with a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at <a href=\"https://www.instaxus.com/cameras/instax-square-sq1/\">$119.95</a>, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.</p>\n\n<p>That said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Now Plus and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.</p>\n\n<p>Fujifilm also sells the newer <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/14/23759847/fujifilms-instax-square-lineup-just-got-a-lot-more-retro\">Instax Square SQ40</a>. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at <a href=\"https://www.instaxus.com/cameras/instax-square-sq40/\">$149.95</a>. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos and rarely goes on sale, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"instax-wide-evo-hybrid\"><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1875107-REG/fujifilm_16840957_instax_wide_evo_instant.html\">Instax Wide Evo Hybrid</a></h3>\n\n<p>Fujifilm’s forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348502/fujifilm-instax-wide-evo-hybrid-instant-camera-photography-printer\">Instax Wide Evo Hybrid</a> is nearly identical to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786676/fujifilm-instax-mini-evo-announced-price-release-date\">Instax Mini Evo</a>. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $349 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. While it’s currently available in Japan and Australia, it won’t be available in the US until September 16th.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Instax Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lens and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, unlike the Wide 400, it’s a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful perk that can cut down on wasted shots. However, at $349, it’s a whopping $150 more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects like a dog or a hyper toddler.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"instax-wide-400\"><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/fujifilm-instax-wide-400-green-instant-camera/-/A-91347440\">Instax Wide 400</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $349 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $149.95 <a href=\"https://www.instaxus.com/cameras/instax-wide-400-instant-camera/\">Instax Wide 400</a> is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar photos to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"instax-mini-41\"><a href=\"https://instax.com/mini41/en/\">Instax Mini 41</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In April, Fujifilm announced the $129.95 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/644752/fujifilm-instax-mini-41#comments\">Instax Mini 41</a>, which is the follow-up to the $99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22367999/fujifilm-instax-mini-40-review-price\">Instax Mini 40</a>. The updated model retains its retro design but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. I’ll be testing it relatively soon and will update this guide with my initial impressions once I have it in hand.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"polaroid-flip\"><a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/flip-polaroid-camera\">Polaroid Flip</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/648398/polaroid-flip-instant-camera-sonar-auto-focus-multi-lens\">Polaroid Flip</a> is a new, $199.99 instant camera that introduces scene analysis, which helps prevent exposure and focus issues by flashing a red LED warning light through the viewfinder. That’s a handy addition, as Polaroid says the Flip has the most powerful flash of any of its instant cameras (though its intensity can be adjusted to prevent overexposing close-ups). In addition, the Flip features&nbsp;new autofocus capabilities powered by a sonar sensor that automatically selects from one of four lenses. </p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"polaroid-now-plus-generation-3\"><a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\">Polaroid Now Plus Generation 3</a></h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Polaroid launched the <a href=\"https://www.polaroid.com/en_us/products/now-plus-polaroid-camera\">Now Plus Generation 3</a>, a sequel to our current pick for the best retro-inspired camera. The new model is nearly identical to the second-gen Now Plus, only it’s available in six colors and features a built-in tripod. It also benefits from autofocus improvements and a better light meter position, which, according to Polaroid, should result in better photos. Like the aforementioned Mini 41, I’ll be updating this guide with my thoughts once I’ve had some hands-on time with it.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, July 18th:</strong> Adjusted pricing/availability, updated the second-gen Poloroid Go blurb to reflect a recent price increase, and added the US release date for Fujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, and Kodak.\n \n\nThe best instant camera for most people\nBest premium instant camera\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\nThe best instant camera for portability\nOther instant cameras to consider\nWhat’s coming next\n\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus and Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\nThe best instant camera for most people\nFujifilm Instax Mini 12\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nProduces relatively true-to-life photos\nTerrific ease of use\nVery affordable\n\nInstax film can get pricey\nMinimal creative control\nFlash can be overpowering\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $79.95 $79 at Amazon\n $79.99 at Best Buy\n $79.99 at Target\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for those new to photography and kids.\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.\nHowever, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.\nYou can also now zoom in a little easier thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter the Close-Up Mode in lieu of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new “Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left.\nAll in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it also doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.\nBest premium instant camera\nFujifilm Instax Mini Evo\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat use of dials and buttons\nLots of printing flexibility\nGood battery life\n\nInternal storage is limited\nMicro USB port is annoying\nNo viewfinder\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199.99 at Amazon\n $199.95 at B&H Photo\n $199.99 at Target\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\nOne of Fujifilm’s newest instant cameras, the Instax Mini Evo, was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a brown version and limited edition models in silver and gold.\nIt’s easy to balk at its $199 price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\nUnlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed out, which was helpful given neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 are particularly great at capturing dark environments.\nAdditionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.\nOf course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add some filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps available for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely on internal storage solely, you can only take 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.\nRead our Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo review.\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\nKodak Mini Shot 3 Retro\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLets you print photos from your phone\nEntertaining companion app\nComes with film\n\nSo-so image quality \nUnable to store images\nNot as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.99 $139.99 at Amazon (with 8 sheets)\n $169.99 $149.99 at Kodak (with 8 sheets)\n $169.99 $149.99 at Walmart (with 8 sheets)\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app allows you to apply frames, stickers, filters, and a plethora of customization options to photos, making the camera great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature within the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making this a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\nLike the Instax Mini Evo, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro comes with an LCD screen (albeit a much smaller one) you can use to decide whether or not you want to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of a film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; you can currently pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than both Fujifilm’s and Polaroid’s.\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint that can interfere with quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.\nNonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\nPolaroid Now Plus (second-gen)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nHandsome, retro design\nPrints dreamy, vintage-style photos \nSeveral creative modes\nUSB-C\n\nStruggles in low light\nFilm takes up to 15 minutes to develop\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $149.99 $114.99 at Amazon\n $149.99 $114.99 at B&H Photo\n $149.99 at Best Buy\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 451.5 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Lens filter kit, film counter\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the camera for you. Compared to the other instant cameras on this list, it most closely resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 with its classic, retro-inspired design. Meanwhile, its square I-Type film prints and iconic Polaroid-style frame give photos a more authentically vintage look. \nAt the same time, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus comes with a suite of modern features, including support for USB-C charging. It also offers Bluetooth and a companion app that boasts several creative modes, allowing greater photographic control. These include a remote shutter, a self-timer, and the “Polaroid Lab,” which lets you adjust the exposure and various color settings. The app also features a handful of shooting modes — including a manual option — and the camera comes with a set of five colored lenses you can snap onto the front. These were enjoyable to play with and allowed for more artistic expression.\nIf there’s one thing the Polaroid Now Plus isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given how heavy, large, and awkwardly sized it is, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Plus, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you have to ensure it’s not exposed to light while developing. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day.\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that can easily print a good, clear photo without much effort on your part, this is not the camera for you. Of all the cameras on this list, the latest Polaroid Now Plus struggles with low-light environments the most. I could barely see images I took indoors, and I could only get the clearest shots when the light was directly behind me during the day — specifically, in the morning. Even these images weren’t as clear in comparison to Instax film, and both contrast and color saturation levels tend to be quite low.\nAdmittedly, this gave my pictures more of a dreamy vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming. Given all these issues, I found it was easy to waste film, which proved expensive. After all, you only get eight I-Type sheets for $16.99, and that’s in addition to forking out $149.99 for the camera.\nTruth be told, however, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, and you don’t mind the price, the second-gen Polaroid Now Plus is the perfect camera for you.\nAll that being said, it’s worth pointing out that Polaroid recently launched the $139.99 Now Plus Generation 3. The instant camera costs $10 less than its predecessor’s MSRP, though, at the moment, the second-gen model is on sale starting at $114.99. The new camera seems like it’s largely an iterative update, with a built-in tripod and four new colors to choose from instead of just three. It should also offer brighter, more accurate lighting in high-contrast scenes and improved depth perception, courtesy of upgrades to the ranging sensor, light meter position, and autofocus.\nThe best instant camera for portability\nPolaroid Go (second-gen)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTiny and lightweight\nPrints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid Now Plus\nUSB-C\n\nStruggles in low light\nFilm takes up to 15 minutes to develop\nNo Bluetooth support or companion app\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89.99 $67.6 at Amazon\n $89.99 at Polaroid\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\nWhereas the Polaroid Now Plus is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It easily fits into the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it easily the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.\nWeighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Now Plus and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.\nAt $89.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, even with its recent $10 price increase. Its film also costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about $19.99 for a 16-sheet pack). The camera also sports a small number of upgrades over the last-gen model despite retailing for less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to spend money on AA batteries.\nPolaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference from one generation to the next. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go — like the Now Plus — produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Now Plus.\nUnlike the Now Plus, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.\nThat said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that provides a more traditional instant film experience — one they can take advantage of just about anywhere for half the price of the Polaroid Now Plus.\nOther instant cameras to consider\nKodak Smile Plus\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera you can use to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $99.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers. \nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark. \nThat being said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app that’s similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software is not as snappy or feature-rich, it still allows you to add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it can often be found for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\nLeica Sofort 2\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s hard to recommend at $389 since most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The user interface is easier to navigate on the Leica, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also like that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\nInstax Mini 99\nIf you’re looking for an analog instant camera that’s more advanced, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $169 ($30 off), Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click camera given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket and an aluminum extension column, as well as a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur while capturing fast-moving subjects.\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12 and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera and not a hybrid like the $199.99 Mini Evo, meaning you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The new model also isn’t as simple to use as the Mini 12, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters. \nInstax Square SQ1\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Instax Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and comes with a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $119.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.\nThat said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Now Plus and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $149.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos and rarely goes on sale, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\nInstax Wide Evo Hybrid\nFujifilm’s forthcoming Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $349 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. While it’s currently available in Japan and Australia, it won’t be available in the US until September 16th.\nUltimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Instax Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lens and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, it’s a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful perk that can cut down on wasted shots. However, at $349, it’s a whopping $150 more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects like a dog or a hyper toddler.\nInstax Wide 400\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $349 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $149.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar photos to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\nWhat’s coming next\nInstax Mini 41\nIn April, Fujifilm announced the $129.95 Instax Mini 41, which is the follow-up to the $99 Instax Mini 40. The updated model retains its retro design but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups. I’ll be testing it relatively soon and will update this guide with my initial impressions once I have it in hand.\nPolaroid Flip\nThe Polaroid Flip is a new, $199.99 instant camera that introduces scene analysis, which helps prevent exposure and focus issues by flashing a red LED warning light through the viewfinder. That’s a handy addition, as Polaroid says the Flip has the most powerful flash of any of its instant cameras (though its intensity can be adjusted to prevent overexposing close-ups). In addition, the Flip features new autofocus capabilities powered by a sonar sensor that automatically selects from one of four lenses. \nPolaroid Now Plus Generation 3\nPolaroid launched the Now Plus Generation 3, a sequel to our current pick for the best retro-inspired camera. The new model is nearly identical to the second-gen Now Plus, only it’s available in six colors and features a built-in tripod. It also benefits from autofocus improvements and a better light meter position, which, according to Polaroid, should result in better photos. Like the aforementioned Mini 41, I’ll be updating this guide with my thoughts once I’ve had some hands-on time with it.\nUpdate, July 18th: Adjusted pricing/availability, updated the second-gen Poloroid Go blurb to reflect a recent price increase, and added the US release date for Fujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo.","summary":"Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera.

The White House has said the venture creates no conflicts for the president as his assets are in a trust managed by his kids. \n“Through his crypto businesses, President Trump has created an efficient means to trade presidential favors like tariff exemptions, pardons, and government appointments for hundreds of millions—perhaps billions—of dollars from foreign governments, from billionaires, and from large corporations,” Warren said. “This is the single greatest corruption scandal in American history and, by passing the GENIUS Act, the Senate is about to not only bless this corruption, but to actively facilitate its expansion.”\nAs Trump signed the GENIUS Act, he tried to steer attention to what he’s billed as “a big scandal” for his predecessor. “This is not an autopen, by the way.” Trump quipped.","summary":"In a landmark victory for the crypto industry, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a regulatory framework for a type of digital currency known as stablecoins. The GENIUS Act creates rules for entities that issue stablecoins, whose value is tied to an asset like the US dollar.
