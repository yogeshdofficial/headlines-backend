The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we test wireless earbuds</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, with earbud makers often reserving certain software tricks for their own preferred ecosystem, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Comfort</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip I can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one of your ears needs something bigger or smaller than the other.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Good sound</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, I care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music I’m listening to. I want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. I look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in my favorite songs.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Active noise cancellation</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Long battery life</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Most earbuds these days can reach between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Water resistance</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At minimum, you should be looking for earbuds that offer IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#NRILW6\">The best overall wireless earbuds</a></li><li><a href=\"#d26N53\">The best budget earbuds under $100</a></li><li><a href=\"#UWDcU8\">The best noise-canceling earbuds</a></li><li><a href=\"#09JCVi\">The best earbuds for sports and working out</a></li><li><a href=\"#MzRNQU\">The best earbuds for iPhone owners</a></li><li><a href=\"#UDK4Rq\">The best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners</a></li><li><a href=\"#NUGgdY\">The best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners</a></li><li><a href=\"#dv7Dfx\">The best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices</a></li><li><a href=\"#ziSHXY\">The best earbuds for sound quality</a></li><li><a href=\"#pZuYRQ\">The best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone</a></li><li><a href=\"#pTcGEr\">The best earbuds for voice calls on Android</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"NRILW6\">The best overall wireless earbuds</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life:</strong> 8 hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> Yes / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Foam (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Just like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.</p>\n\n<p>Some people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24805959/DSCF2249_Enhanced_NR.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" title=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The WF-1000XM5 are smaller and more comfortable than their M4 predecessors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SUJOO3\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23803374/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review\">Read our&nbsp;full WF-1000XM5 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d26N53\">The best budget earbuds under $100</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>5.5<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP54 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25406202/DSCF6918.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of new earbuds from Nothing.\" title=\"A photo of new earbuds from Nothing.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Ear (a) are Nothing’s first earbuds that aren’t only offered black or white.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point.

Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"9kRlVK\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23883649/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review\">Read our&nbsp;full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"09JCVi\">The best earbuds for sports and working out</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>8<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.</p>\n\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/620706/powerbeats-pro-2-apple-heart-rate-gym-equipment\">can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment</a> when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.<br></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257536_Powerbeats_Pro_2_AKrales_0129.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro 2 have an ear-hook design for maximum stability.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more.

The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint.

Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25523619/DSCF8084.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A hands-on product photo of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 / Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.\" title=\"A hands-on product photo of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 / Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Buds 3 Pro are an ideal match for Samsung’s latest phones.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality.

You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.</p>\n\n<p>But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem.

And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Google’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25640457/DSC_0115.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A hands-on photo of Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds.\" title=\"A hands-on photo of Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Google really downsized the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (bottom) compared to the original pair (top).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>Got a Pixel phone?

This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24662272/DSCF0775_Enhanced_NR.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of Beats’ translucent Studio Buds Plus earbuds.\" title=\"A photo of Beats’ translucent Studio Buds Plus earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The translucent color option has a very ‘90s vibe.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>What’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.</p>\n\n<p>The drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get <em>all</em> the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"N3Z6oA\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23725921/beats-studio-buds-plus-earbuds-review-translucent-clear\">Read our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ziSHXY\">The best earbuds for sound quality</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>7.5 hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP54 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint: </strong>Yes / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25311363/DSC_0469_Enhanced_NR.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds in copper.\" title=\"A photo of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds in copper.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;That copper finish is pretty nice.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>These earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears.

However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"PxCkgD\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24245570/apple-airpods-4-review\">Read our full AirPods 4 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pTcGEr\">The best earbuds for voice calls on Android</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>6<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP57 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (S, M, L)</em></em></em></em></p>\n\n<p>Sony’s unconventional <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22933521/sony-linkbuds-earbuds-review-features-specs\">LinkBuds</a> were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors.

The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\nFeatured in this article\n\n\nHow we test wireless earbuds\nWhether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, with earbud makers often reserving certain software tricks for their own preferred ecosystem, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nComfort\nNo matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip I can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one of your ears needs something bigger or smaller than the other.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood sound\nJust like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, I care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music I’m listening to. I want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. I look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in my favorite songs.\n\n\n\n\n\nActive noise cancellation\nWhat was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong battery life\nMost earbuds these days can reach between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with.\n\n\n\n\n\nWater resistance\nEven if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At minimum, you should be looking for earbuds that offer IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead our full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my full Nothing Ear (a) impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nBose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job at offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life and putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts.\nThe QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II in terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio.\nRead our full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nFor those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option.\nThe AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you.\nWhere the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem.\nIn the fall, Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health features for the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss.\nRead our original AirPods Pro (second-gen) review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, I’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.\nThe Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And my favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.\nBut they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but I’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nThe best earbuds for Google Pixel phone owners\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nWith the Pixel Buds Pro 2, Google has addressed most of the downsides of the original pair. They’re far smaller and lighter than the chunky first-gen Pixel Buds Pro. And there’s a small nub on the buds to help lock them in place even during intensive activities like running or exercise.\nGoogle’s active noise cancellation still isn’t on the same tier as Bose, but the transparency mode on the Buds Pro 2 is among the very best you’ll find. It offers a crisp, natural passthrough for the outside world when needed. Multipoint support is included, and Google’s latest earbuds eke out impressive battery life that surpasses most competitors.\nGot a Pixel phone? With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you can have lengthy conversations with Google’s Gemini AI while your phone stays in your pocket. Features like head-tracking spatial audio and Clear Calling are also exclusive to those within the Pixel ecosystem. If that’s you, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are a big step up from the previous buds in a much smaller package.\nRead our full Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds if you own both Apple and Android devices\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nBeats’ Studio Buds Plus are an upgraded, better-performing revision of the Studio Buds released in 2021. This time, the company has made the noise cancellation more powerful while also improving the quality of the transparency mode and extending battery life. If you’re going for style points, it doesn’t get much cooler than the translucent color option. These earbuds are very tiny and rank up with the best in terms of overall comfort.\nWhat’s interesting about the Studio Buds Plus is that they use a proprietary chip that allows them to support native software features on both iOS and Android. Plenty of earbuds offer companion apps on each platform, but in the case of the Beats, they work with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find My Device. You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead our full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead our full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead our full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for me during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear me without issue, even when I’m answering a quick call on the street.\nRead our full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge except where specified\nUpdate, June 5th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability, along with several new links.","summary":"It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good of a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing.

While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/15/24177306/apple-foldable-phone-ipados-18\">Imagine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/20/23730130/apple-iphone-13-mini-apple-phones\">I have my own</a>, personally.)</p>\n\n<p>As you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we test smartphones</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23775534/switch-phones-ios-android-iphone-google-pixel-samsung-esim\">so routine that it’s mostly painless</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Longevity</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">A great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which as awesome. As a bare minimum three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A great screen</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">The best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Quality cameras</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Any phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Wireless charging</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Most phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for a lot of people since it’s convenient for charging many different kinds of devices.<br></p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#ueIawV\">The best Android phone overall</a></li><li><a href=\"#d1zQdW\">The best maximalist phone</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-android-phone-that-isn-t-huge\">The best Android phone that isn’t huge</a></li><li><a href=\"#oV1Wae\">The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge</a></li><li><a href=\"#SbewYq\">The best foldable phone</a></li><li><a href=\"#W3yT1i\">Other Android phones worth considering</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ueIawV\">The best Android phone overall</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / <strong>Processor: </strong>Tensor G4 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 10.5-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,700mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 27W wired, 15W wireless (with Pixel Stand 2) / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Google’s hardware is better than ever, and the whole Pixel 9 lineup feels just as polished as anything you’d get from Samsung or Apple. But at $799 (and often less than that), the basic Pixel 9 is in a particularly appealing position, and if you don’t need a telephoto camera or the biggest screen, then this is the Android phone to get.</p>\n\n<p>The Pixel 9 comes with some significant quality-of-life improvements like a faster fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone.

The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/DSC09411_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hQgZWo\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery\">Read my full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-android-phone-that-isn-t-huge\">The best Android phone that isn’t huge</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Screen:</strong><i> 6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120hz OLED / </i><strong>Processor:</strong><i> </i><em><em>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</em></em><i> </i><strong>Cameras:</strong><i> </i><em>50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie</em> <em><strong>Battery:</strong> 4000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> <em><em>25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) &nbsp;</em></em> / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> </em>IP68</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the <em>regular</em> S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257552_Samsung_Galaxy_S25_review_AJohnson_0005.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default.

It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit <em>much</em>, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oV1Wae\">The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / <strong>Processor:</strong> Snapdragon 8 Elite / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>6,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 80W wired, 50W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP6</em>8 and IP69</em></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257469_OnePlus_13_AJohnson_0003.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;This vegan leather back panel is so nice.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge&nbsp;— and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wTR5JS\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24336534/oneplus-13-review-specs-screen-camera-battery\">Read my full OnePlus 13 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SbewYq\">The best foldable phone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>8.0-inch 2076p 120Hz OLED inner screen, 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED cover screen / <strong>Processor:</strong> Tensor G4 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen), 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,650mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IPX8</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Does anyone truly need a folding phone? Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen.</p>\n\n<p>The 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones.

While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! Imagine.\nOn the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.)\nAs you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.\n\n\nHow we test smartphones\nThere’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.\n\n\n\n\n\nLongevity\nA great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which as awesome. As a bare minimum three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nA great screen\nThe best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality cameras\nAny phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well.\n\n\n\n\n\nWireless charging\nMost phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for a lot of people since it’s convenient for charging many different kinds of devices.\n\n\n\n\nIf you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations. \nWith that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal. \nHowever you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Android phone overall\nThe best maximalist phone\nThe best Android phone that isn’t huge\nThe best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge\nThe best foldable phone\nOther Android phones worth considering\nWhat’s coming next\n\nThe best Android phone overall\nScreen: 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 48-megapixel ultrawide, 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 27W wired, 15W wireless (with Pixel Stand 2) / Weather resistance: IP68\nGoogle’s hardware is better than ever, and the whole Pixel 9 lineup feels just as polished as anything you’d get from Samsung or Apple. But at $799 (and often less than that), the basic Pixel 9 is in a particularly appealing position, and if you don’t need a telephoto camera or the biggest screen, then this is the Android phone to get.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with some significant quality-of-life improvements like a faster fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone. The camera is as reliable as ever, and if you’re into AI photo editing tricks, boy does this phone have ‘em. There’s a new Screenshots app that acts as a place to store all of the information that would otherwise be lost at sea in your camera roll, and it uses AI to parse information out and make it searchable. Kinda handy.\nEven without AI, this is an excellent phone. It’s also designed to go the distance, with seven years of promised OS updates, which very likely means you’ll outgrow the phone before Google stops supporting it. Its potential for long-term value and the quality of the hardware make it an easy recommendation for anyone who just wants a nice Android phone that works.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9 review.\nThe best maximalist phone\nScreen: 6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather resistance: IP68\nThere’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy.\nThe newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents.\nAll of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.\nRead my full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nThe best Android phone that isn’t huge\nScreen: 6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie Battery: 4000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready)   / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nMost people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.\nThat’s the regular S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.\nThe Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit much, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.\nThe best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge\nScreen: 6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 and IP69\nThere are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.\nThe OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.\nRead my full OnePlus 13 review.\nThe best foldable phone\nScreen: 8.0-inch 2076p 120Hz OLED inner screen, 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen), 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,650mAh / Charging: 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather resistance: IPX8\nDoes anyone truly need a folding phone? Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen.\nThe 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach.\nThat said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow. For the adventurous early adopter, though, the 9 Pro Fold will be very rewarding.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review.\nOther Android phones worth considering\nThere are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.\nFirst off, there’s the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung’s excellent clamshell-style foldable. It’s not as much fun to use as the 2025 Razr Ultra — which facilitates using apps on the cover screen more easily — but Motorola’s track record for software updates isn’t great, so the Z Flip 6 is a safer bet for a flip phone.

Nintendo has also finally added a 3.5mm audio jack, allowing you to pair it with a headset or a set of wired headphones.

We’ll likely see a wealth of third-party brands release their own version in the coming weeks, but Nintendo’s proprietary offering is one of the few reputable offerings available at launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bundle — which includes a console-only carrying case, screen protector, and cleaning cloth&nbsp;— is only available for around $39.88 at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-Carrying-Case-Screen-Protector/15955005002/\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-38-screen-protector/-/A-94704603/\">Target</a>, even if it was originally available elsewhere.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case\">Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nintendo also just launched an All-In-One Carrying Case, which is more spacious than the model mentioned above. The higher-end case features separate compartments for stowing the console and various goodies, including the Switch 2 dock, Joy-Con 2 controllers, cables, and up to six game cards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, while it was initially available at most big-name retailers (including <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-All-In-One-Carrying-Case/15954955010/\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"http://gamestop.com/gaming-accessories/cases-stands/nintendo-switch-2/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case/20021981.html\">GameStop</a>), it’s currently only available directly from <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/\">Nintendo</a> for $84.99.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"where-to-preorder-the-switch-2-camera\">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Supposedly, you can video chat with friends via GameChat using any compatible USB-C camera, but Nintendo offers its own solution in the form of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch\">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a>. The 1080p camera is designed to sit on a stand, allowing you to display your face as a picture-in-picture overlay or as a dedicated video feed.

The company also introduced a range of new accessories for its new gaming console, the bulk of which are now available online at Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop, and Target. From a redesigned Pro Controller to a camera that lets you video chat with your friends, each is designed to level up your gaming experience.\nSadly, President Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff policy has resulted in slight price bumps on several Switch 2 accessories — including the aforementioned Pro 2 Controller. There’s no telling whether we can expect more price hikes down the line, either, meaning if you have secured a Switch 2 and want to pick up a second controller or another accessory to go with it, now might be the time to act.\n\n\n\n\n\n Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nJoy-Con 2 controllers\nJoy-Con 2 Wheel (set of two)\nNintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector\nNintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case\nNintendo Switch 2 Camera\nOther Switch 2 accessories\n\n Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\nThe removable Joy-Cons are great for portable and wireless play, but their small, curveless design can feel cramped during longer sessions if you have larger hands. That’s why the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller might be worth a look, especially if you mostly game in TV mode. The upgraded version of one of our favorite Nintendo Switch controller features a few welcome improvements, including a pair of rear GL and GR buttons players can use to remap other controls. Nintendo has also finally added a 3.5mm audio jack, allowing you to pair it with a headset or a set of wired headphones. The gamepad even features the aforementioned “C” button.\nAs of writing, you can pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro controller for $84.99 at Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Antonline. It’s also currently on sale at Costco for $74.99 ($10 off), though, per usual, you’ll need a premium membership to take advantage of the latter deal.\nJoy-Con 2 controllers\nNintendo’s Joy-Con controllers are bigger than the original and snap onto the Switch 2 magnetically, eliminating the need for sliding rails. The right Joy-Con also features the new “C” button, which you can use to pull up Nintendo’s new in-game chat system, GameChat, which will be free until March 31st, 2026. While the second-gen controllers don’t feature Hall effect joysticks, Nintendo says they’ve been redesigned for smoother movement. The Joy-Con 2s also feature new optical sensors, which let you them like mice in compatible games.\nThe Switch 2 comes with a pair of Joy-Cons, but if you want a second pair, you can currently grab them for around $94 at Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and the My Nintendo Store.\nJoy-Con 2 Wheel (set of two)\nIf you plan on picking up the new Mario Kart World — or you were lucky enough to snag Nintendo’s limited time bundle — the Joy-Con 2 Wheels are worth a look. Simply snap the Joy-Con 2 controllers, which connect magnetically, into the steering wheel attachments before booting up your preferred racing title. The two-wheel set is currently available for around $24.88 from Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Nintendo.\nNintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector\nThe Switch 2 is a pricey gadget you’ll want to keep safe, so it’s a good idea to invest in a carrying case like the Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector. We’ll likely see a wealth of third-party brands release their own version in the coming weeks, but Nintendo’s proprietary offering is one of the few reputable offerings available at launch.\nThe bundle — which includes a console-only carrying case, screen protector, and cleaning cloth — is only available for around $39.88 at Walmart and Target, even if it was originally available elsewhere.\nNintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case\nNintendo also just launched an All-In-One Carrying Case, which is more spacious than the model mentioned above. The higher-end case features separate compartments for stowing the console and various goodies, including the Switch 2 dock, Joy-Con 2 controllers, cables, and up to six game cards.\nUnfortunately, while it was initially available at most big-name retailers (including Walmart and GameStop), it’s currently only available directly from Nintendo for $84.99.\nNintendo Switch 2 Camera\nSupposedly, you can video chat with friends via GameChat using any compatible USB-C camera, but Nintendo offers its own solution in the form of the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera. The 1080p camera is designed to sit on a stand, allowing you to display your face as a picture-in-picture overlay or as a dedicated video feed. A few titles, such as the upgraded version of Super Mario Party Jamboree, let you see your friends on-screen while you play. Some mini-games even incorporate the camera into the game experience itself.\nThe camera features an adjustable wide-angle lens, designed to capture groups of people in a single shot, as well as a “high-sensitivity image sensor” that automatically adjusts brightness levels. It also features a built-in privacy shutter and includes a USB-C charging cable, as well as support for TV, tabletop, and handheld modes.\nYou can currently order it for around $54 from Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and Nintendo.\nJoy-Con 2 Charging Grip\nUnlike the standard Joy-Con 2 grip that comes with the Switch 2, Nintendo’s so-called Charging Grip features customizable GL and GR buttons — just like the Switch 2 Pro Controller — and can be used to charge your Joy-Cons via an included USB-C cable. Otherwise, it appears pretty similar in functionality to the original Switch’s charging grip, allowing you to combine the Joy-Con 2 controllers for a more traditional gamepad.\nRight now, you can pick up the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip starting at $39.88 from Walmart, GameStop, and Nintendo.\nOther Switch 2 accessories\nNintendo also released a handful of smaller accessories this week, including Joy-Con 2 straps, AC adapters, and a standalone dock set for those who want a second.
