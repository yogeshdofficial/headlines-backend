Each is designed to magnetically attach to the back of the Flip Folio case without adding too much thickness. It includes dedicated iPadOS shortcut keys and multi-device Bluetooth pairing so you can easily switch between using it with your tablet, smartphone, or even a computer.\nBattery life is estimated to be up to two years, but that will depend on how frequently you’re using the keyboard. When it dies, you’ll need to replace its coin cell battery, because the keyboard doesn’t feature a rechargeable battery or even a USB port for connecting it to a device with a cable. It’s wireless all the way.\nThe Flip Folio case itself offers front and back protection for your iPad. Since it connects to the tablet magnetically, you can position the iPad in either landscape or portrait orientations when using it as a multi-angle support stand. With the iPad supported vertically, the Flip Folio has a bit of extra room for supporting a smartphone, too, letting you position them side by side and expand your multitasking.","summary":"Logitech has announced a new keyboard case for iPad Pro and iPad Air models that lets you remove and position its keyboard exactly where you need it.

Even Oura’s relatively affordable $6 monthly fee can feel more like $100 when you consider the sheer number of apps, gadgets, and services asking for a chunk of your monthly paycheck. However, Oura is still the best in terms of hardware, size range, features offered, app, dedication to research, and experience in the field. Many of the smart rings available today follow the example Oura set this past decade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The upgrades from the Oura Ring Gen 3 to the Oura Ring 4 were mostly software-based, with minor hardware refinements. You can read <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">more in my review</a>, but the gist is a more accurate heart rate and blood oxygen algorithm, improved automatic activity detection, and an expanded range that spans size 4 to 15. The app has been redesigned to be less cluttered, and in the last few weeks, Oura <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/661069/oura-dexcom-stelo-meals-glucose-metabolic-health-wearables\">added AI-powered meal logging and glucose tracking</a>, the latter of which requires Oura users to <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/product/dexcom/stelo-glucose-biosensor\">purchase a Dexcom Stelo CGM</a> ($99). It also recently launched <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/639576/oura-advisor-ai-chatbot-wearables\">an AI chatbot</a>. (Of the AI chatbots in health trackers I’ve tested, this one is among the more polished implementations — though it often feels like Captain Obvious-level insights.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve been long-term testing three iterations of the Oura Ring since 2018. Accuracy, design, and comfort have improved with each generation. The company continues to frequently and clearly communicate research and scientific developments. Third-party retail options have expanded, and I’ve seen <a href=\"https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2024/Dexcom-and-URA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership/default.aspx\">investment pour into Oura</a>. In an emerging category, these things matter. A lot. While I believe some of Oura’s newer competitors do some things better or have more creative ideas, Oura is the one I continually recommend for its combination of reliability, accuracy, and experience.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">Read my full Oura Ring 4 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Honorable mentions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If subscriptions are an absolute dealbreaker, you’ll find zero protest here. In that case, here are the best alternatives to the Oura Ring.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The $400 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables\"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Ring</strong></a><strong> </strong>nails the hardware. Its charging case is more elegant than the Oura Ring’s, and I prefer the slightly concave design for comfort. It also has the second widest size range. If you’re already all-in on a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Ultra</a>, you get the added benefit of extended battery life. If you have the latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211507/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review-screen-battery-camera\">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24204714/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-screen-battery-camera\">Z Fold 6</a>, Samsung also has gesture controls for the ring so you can control the camera.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a lot of interesting ecosystem-centric ideas that Samsung has for its Galaxy Ring, but while there’s no subscription, it’ll cost you a pretty penny to unlock the ring’s full potential. Without discounts, we’re talking about $1,800 to nearly $3,000 for the phone, watch, and ring. The Galaxy Ring is also a first-gen device with some first-gen quirks, too. Samsung is still catching up with sleep tracking accuracy, and its Galaxy AI-powered health features are rather hit or miss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m also keen on the $350 <strong><a href=\"https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/us/\">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a></strong>. It gave the Oura Ring an honest run for its money when I tested six smart rings at once last year. It’s not quite as good with accuracy, but it’s on par with comfort and design. The app has much more of a fitness focus than wellness. Instead of a subscription, it has “Power Plugs.” You can think of them as add-on features. Some are free, like smart alarms and cycle tracking. Others will come with an additional fee, like a planned atrial fibrillation detection Power Plug and a cardio adaptability metric, which costs $2.90 a month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lastly, I’ve been testing the <strong><a href=\"https://ringconn.com/products/ringconn-gen-2-air?variant=48494897791284\">RingConn Gen 2 Air</a></strong>, a slimmer, entry-level version of its Gen 2 ring. At $200, it’s the most affordable smart ring I’ve tested but looks and feels a lot nicer than the original RingConn I tested last summer. I had issues with the RingConn’s squarish shape, but it’s much less noticeable this time around and more comfortable. It’s broadly accurate, and the app goes heavy on AI, to middling effect. It has great battery life. I’ve gotten around eight to nine days on a single charge — far better than any other smart ring I’ve tested.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, June 10th: </strong>Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and add several related links.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"So, you’re thinking of buying a smart ring.

You can read more in my review, but the gist is a more accurate heart rate and blood oxygen algorithm, improved automatic activity detection, and an expanded range that spans size 4 to 15. The app has been redesigned to be less cluttered, and in the last few weeks, Oura added AI-powered meal logging and glucose tracking, the latter of which requires Oura users to purchase a Dexcom Stelo CGM ($99). It also recently launched an AI chatbot. (Of the AI chatbots in health trackers I’ve tested, this one is among the more polished implementations — though it often feels like Captain Obvious-level insights.) \nI’ve been long-term testing three iterations of the Oura Ring since 2018. Accuracy, design, and comfort have improved with each generation. The company continues to frequently and clearly communicate research and scientific developments. Third-party retail options have expanded, and I’ve seen investment pour into Oura. In an emerging category, these things matter. A lot. While I believe some of Oura’s newer competitors do some things better or have more creative ideas, Oura is the one I continually recommend for its combination of reliability, accuracy, and experience.\nRead my full Oura Ring 4 review.\nHonorable mentions\nIf subscriptions are an absolute dealbreaker, you’ll find zero protest here. In that case, here are the best alternatives to the Oura Ring. \nThe $400 Samsung Galaxy Ring nails the hardware. Its charging case is more elegant than the Oura Ring’s, and I prefer the slightly concave design for comfort. It also has the second widest size range. If you’re already all-in on a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or Ultra, you get the added benefit of extended battery life. If you have the latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6, Samsung also has gesture controls for the ring so you can control the camera.\nThere are a lot of interesting ecosystem-centric ideas that Samsung has for its Galaxy Ring, but while there’s no subscription, it’ll cost you a pretty penny to unlock the ring’s full potential. Without discounts, we’re talking about $1,800 to nearly $3,000 for the phone, watch, and ring. The Galaxy Ring is also a first-gen device with some first-gen quirks, too. Samsung is still catching up with sleep tracking accuracy, and its Galaxy AI-powered health features are rather hit or miss.\nI’m also keen on the $350 Ultrahuman Ring Air. It gave the Oura Ring an honest run for its money when I tested six smart rings at once last year. It’s not quite as good with accuracy, but it’s on par with comfort and design. The app has much more of a fitness focus than wellness. Instead of a subscription, it has “Power Plugs.” You can think of them as add-on features. Some are free, like smart alarms and cycle tracking. Others will come with an additional fee, like a planned atrial fibrillation detection Power Plug and a cardio adaptability metric, which costs $2.90 a month.\nLastly, I’ve been testing the RingConn Gen 2 Air, a slimmer, entry-level version of its Gen 2 ring. At $200, it’s the most affordable smart ring I’ve tested but looks and feels a lot nicer than the original RingConn I tested last summer. I had issues with the RingConn’s squarish shape, but it’s much less noticeable this time around and more comfortable. It’s broadly accurate, and the app goes heavy on AI, to middling effect. It has great battery life. I’ve gotten around eight to nine days on a single charge — far better than any other smart ring I’ve tested. \nUpdate, June 10th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability and add several related links.","summary":"So, you’re thinking of buying a smart ring. Well, some good news. Picking the best of the lot is incredibly easy right now. The “bad” news is that, as far as trustworthiness and reliability, your choices are somewhat limited, as this is still a niche and emerging gadget category.
