Currently, these devices are primarily health trackers. Their benefit is that they’re more discreet and better suited to sleep tracking than a smartwatch. However, the vast majority don’t include smart alarms or push notifications. This makes them best suited for casual athletes or more wellness-minded people. In most cases, hardcore athletes would be better served by a smartwatch or fitness tracker, with a smart ring serving as a supplementary source of data. (But that’s <em>quite</em> an expensive endeavor.) Smart rings are also ill-suited for weightlifters, as they can easily scratch against equipment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With that in mind, here’s the best smart ring for most people in 2025 — and a handful of runners-up worth highlighting for the more tech-adventurous.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Best smart ring for most people</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Oura Ring 4</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Oura Ring 4 has a new all-titanium design, improved battery life, and better accuracy thanks to a new sensor algorithm. </div>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25665142/247314_Oura_Ring_4_AKrales_0105.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Close-up of Oura Ring 4\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 9</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>More sizes</li><li>Slimmer design</li><li>Expanded auto workout detection</li><li>Redesigned app</li><li>Better battery life</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Subscription required to get all features</li><li>I still wish this had a charging case</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9WV1TPJ\"> <strike>$349</strike> $342.09 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oura-ring-4-smart-ring-size-before-you-buy-with-oura-ring-4-sizing-kit-size-8-silver/6595517.p\"> $349 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://ouraring.com/product/rings/oura-ring-4/silver\"> $349 at <strong>Oura</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Surprising no one, it’s the Oura Ring 4.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I can already hear some of you shouting, “But what about the subscription!” And I agree. Even Oura’s relatively affordable $5.99 monthly fee can feel more like $100 when you consider the sheer number of apps, gadgets, and services asking for a chunk of your monthly paycheck. However, Oura is still the best in terms of hardware, size range, features offered, app, dedication to research, and experience in the field. Many of the smart rings available today follow the example Oura set this past decade. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The upgrades from the Oura Ring Gen 3 to the Oura Ring 4 were mostly software-based, with minor hardware refinements. You can read <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">more in my review</a>, but the gist is a more accurate heart rate and blood oxygen algorithm, improved automatic activity detection, and an expanded range that spans size 4 to 15. The app has been redesigned to be less cluttered, and in the last few months, Oura <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/661069/oura-dexcom-stelo-meals-glucose-metabolic-health-wearables\">added AI-powered meal logging and glucose tracking</a>, the latter of which requires Oura users to <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/product/dexcom/stelo-glucose-biosensor\">purchase a Dexcom Stelo CGM</a> ($99). It also recently launched <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/639576/oura-advisor-ai-chatbot-wearables\">an AI chatbot</a>. (Of the AI chatbots in health trackers I’ve tested, this one is among the more polished implementations — though it often feels like Captain Obvious-level insights.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve been long-term testing three iterations of the Oura Ring since 2018. Accuracy, design, and comfort have improved with each generation. The company continues to frequently and clearly communicate research and scientific developments. Third-party retail options have expanded, and I’ve seen <a href=\"https://investors.dexcom.com/news/news-details/2024/Dexcom-and-URA-Announce-Strategic-Partnership/default.aspx\">investment pour into Oura</a>. In an emerging category, these things matter. A lot. While I believe some of Oura’s newer competitors do some things better or have more creative ideas, Oura is the one I continually recommend for its combination of reliability, accuracy, and experience.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">Read my full Oura Ring 4 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Honorable mentions</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If subscriptions are an absolute dealbreaker, you’ll find zero protest here.

Its charging case is more elegant than the Oura Ring’s, and I prefer the slightly concave design for comfort. It also has the second widest size range. If you’re already all-in on a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Ultra</a>, you get the added benefit of extended battery life.

Without discounts, we’re talking about $1,800 to nearly $3,000 for the phone, watch, and ring. The Galaxy Ring is also a first-gen device with some first-gen quirks, too.

The app has much more of a fitness focus than wellness. Instead of a subscription, it has “PowerPlugs.” You can think of them as add-on features. Some are free, like smart alarms and cycle tracking.
