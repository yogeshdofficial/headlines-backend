There’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776173/subaru-solterra-electric-suv-specs-range\">the Solterra</a>, now in its third model year, and <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a64442428/2026-subaru-trailseeker-revealed/\">the upcoming Trailseeker</a>, which promises to be the Outback to the Solterra’s Impreza when it comes out in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now we can add a new member to the lineup. The 2026 Subaru Uncharted is an electric crossover SUV that like the Solterra and Trailseeker is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/651786/subaru-solterra-ev-2026-facelift\">built on Toyota’s E-TNGA platform</a>. When it comes out next year, the Uncharted will have more than 300 miles of estimated range, 338 horsepower, and a sporty style befitting one of America’s favorite outdoor automotive brands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With Uncharted, Subaru finally seems like it’s ready to pick up the pace on electrification. Subaru and EVs always seem like a good fit — its customers are a little bit crunchy and enjoy darting up rugged trails in AWD vehicles — so it’s a little confusing that the brand has taken so long to come around to the technology.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-apple-watch-se-deals\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#zdhvKu\">The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#MpVWgd\">A note on the more premium models</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But with all of those options, which one should you pick?

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the introduction of Apple’s newest wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind. Fortunately, the next iteration of watchOS will continue to support the same devices when it arrives in the fall, even if Apple is revamping its naming convention in a bid to standardize its operating system names.\nAll that being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nApple Watch Series 10 (42mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $399 $299 at Amazon\n $399 $299 at Walmart\n $399 $299 at Best Buy\n\n\nApple Watch Series 10 (46mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 $329 at Amazon\n $429 $329 at Walmart\n $429 $329 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($100 off), which is just $20 shy of its recent Prime Day low. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $329 (also $10 off) — which is the second-best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at around $379.99 ($120 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249 $169 at Amazon\n $249 $169 at Walmart\n $249 $169 at Best Buy\n\n\n2022 Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $279 $199 at Amazon\n $279 $199 at Walmart\n $279 $199 at Best Buy\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022.

The streamer is instead highlighting other revenue drivers for the business, like advertising.","summary":"Netflix says it’s on track to “double” its advertising revenue this year as the company continues ot build out its ad tech platform.
