That’s the best news about Apple’s tablet lineup: 15 years after Steve Jobs first debuted the device, the iPad is the best tablet on the market, and it’s not particularly close. Apple’s App Store is enormous and filled with great apps, Apple’s performance and battery life are consistently excellent, and the iPad is still the company’s most versatile device. That’s one easy answer to your question: yes, if you want a tablet you should buy an iPad. Even last year’s iPad, or heck, last-last year’s iPad is still a solid device. Buying an older but better device — last year’s Pro instead of this year’s Air, for instance — is a tried and true iPad formula.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But which of all those good iPads should you buy? That’s never been more complicated. Apple sells six different iPads —&nbsp;the Pro in two sizes, the Air in two sizes, the Mini, and the regular ol’ iPad —&nbsp;all of which come with different specs and accessory options. It’s all too much.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#766tlj\">The best iPad value</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-long-term-ipad\">The best long-term iPad</a></li><li><a href=\"#uqb3Br\">The best iPad, period</a></li><li><a href=\"#sIvlSS\">The best iPad Mini</a></li><li><a href=\"#6h7KwO\">An aside on specs and extras</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve tested every iPad currently on the market and have been an iPad user and reviewer since the very first model. (I’m pretty sure I got a job in 2010 because I had a brand-new iPad with me at the interview, but that’s another story.) After using all these tablets and accessories, I think I can help you make the choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The simplest way to pick an iPad is by process of elimination. First, there’s your budget: you can spend $350 on an iPad, you can spend $2,728 on an iPad, or you can spend just about anything in between. You should also decide whether you need an Apple Pencil and which one has the features you need, because not every iPad supports every model. The same goes for the keyboard attachments. Between price and accessories, your choice might be instantly obvious.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More broadly, though, your iPad-buying journey starts with two crucial questions. The first is: what kind of iPad user are you? There are roughly two types. The first and most common iPad user mostly uses it like a larger iPhone: it’s a bigger screen on which to send emails, do the crossword, watch Netflix, and other fairly casual activities. The second type of iPad user, on the other hand, uses it like a touchscreen Mac: it’s for video editing, 3D modeling, creating presentations, crushing spreadsheets, and generally Doing Work of all sorts. You’ll also email and Netflix, of course, but you want your iPad to be a primary computing device.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think most people fall into the first category. (Honestly, I also think a lot of people who believe they fall into the second category… mostly don’t.)</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second question is more complicated to answer, and it’s what makes the iPad-buying process so tricky right now: how long do you expect to keep your iPad? If you’re looking for a device for the kids to beat up or something that will be your travel companion until you inevitably leave it somewhere, you’re going to end up with a very different device than if you’re shopping for your main computer for the next decade.

If, by some miracle, Apple Intelligence becomes awesome in the next few years, you won’t be able to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you only wanted an iPad to last a couple years, for everyday iPad tasks, I’d tell you to buy this one without a second’s hesitation.

The new M3 chip is only a tiny upgrade over the M2 — I don’t even notice it in day-to-day use — but I’ll never complain about having newer chips. The biggest upgrade to the Air this year is actually the new Magic Keyboard, which adds a row of function keys and makes the setup a much more credible laptop replacement. (The new keyboard also works with the M2 Air, and if you can find that device on sale somewhere, it’s still a great tablet.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The base iPad to iPad Air upgrade is straightforward enough. You get better accessories, a somewhat better screen, and a noticeably better processor for $250. (You also get the option of a 13-inch device for another $200, but I think an 11-inch iPad is the right size for most people —&nbsp;the 13-inch models start to feel more like laptops than tablets.) If you’re playing Netflix and browsing the web, that $250 won’t get you much, but as soon as you start noodling around in Final Cut or even GarageBand, you’ll notice the difference. There’s a lot of room to grow into the Air, whereas the base iPad may hit its ceiling much sooner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The other thing the Air offers that the base iPad doesn’t is Apple Intelligence. Right now, this is not a problem: there is exactly nothing in Apple Intelligence worth spending $250 on. But if you’re an AI believer, you should know that the base iPad won’t get whatever’s coming.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"read-our-full-ipad-air-m3-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025\">Read our full iPad Air M3 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"uqb3Br\"><strong>The best iPad, period</strong></h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>13-inch iPad Pro M4</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The newest iPad Pro comes in either an 11- or 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M4 processor.

The M4 chip is plenty fast even for high-end games and ultra-complex creativity apps. It supports the new, lighter, better Magic Keyboard case and the Pencil Pro.

If we’re just talking about a Netflix and email machine, we’re long past the point of diminishing returns. But if you don’t care, and you just want the best thing money can buy? Here it is.

I very much am: I’ve used a Mini for years as my device for reading in bed, watching movies on airplanes, and playing games on the go. The latest Mini is a bit of a disappointment, with a slightly underpowered processor and an old design that could have used smaller bezels and a relocated camera. But it’s still the iPad Mini, and it’s still good enough for most tablet things. If you want an iPad Mini, this is it.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"EXpfc3\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review\"><strong>Read our full iPad Mini review</strong></a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6h7KwO\">An aside on specs and extras</h2>\n\n<p>Once you’ve picked an iPad model, you still have a bunch of decisions to make. And many of them are about specs and features that will cost you hundreds of dollars. Here are my recommendations for some of the things you’ll encounter:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cellular coverage:</strong> You probably don’t need this. Unless you live in a really remote place, Wi-Fi is available in most places. That said, I’ve found that I use cell-equipped iPads far more often when I can just pull them out and know they’re connected — there’s something about busting it out in the park or on the subway that just feels great. Plus, it’s a really useful hotspot for other devices. This isn’t the first place I’d spend my money, though.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Storage</strong>: This <em>is </em>the first place I’d spend my money. All the iPads now come with at least 128GB of storage, which is a big upgrade —&nbsp;64GB was just never enough. Even now, though, I recommend springing for 256GB if you can afford it; you’d be surprised at how quickly your photos, videos, and Netflix downloads add up.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engraving</strong>: Don’t do this. It screws up returns and makes selling or giving it away harder. Just don’t do it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple Pencil:</strong> As much as I’d love for this to be an all-purpose accessory, it’s really not. Buy it (either the USB-C or the Pro) if you plan to handwrite or draw a lot. Otherwise, skip it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Magic Keyboard: </strong>This is the first accessory I’d recommend to most people — many people type a lot on their iPads, and it’s also a handy stand and dock for the tablet. You can find cheaper keyboard docks than Apple’s, but I haven’t found one I like better. It’s expensive no matter which model you buy, though.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My gadget shopping advice is always to buy the best thing you can afford and hold it for as long as possible, and that’s more doable with an iPad than almost any other device category. If you have the extra $100 to spend on storage, do it. If you want to upgrade because you think AI will get more powerful in the next few years, go for it! Just make sure you know which kind of iPad user you really are, and get the best one you’ll actually make use of. Hopefully for a long time to come.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the first time in a while, the iPad lineup feels fairly up to date. The Air, Mini, and base model have all been updated in the last several months. The Pro is actually the oldest device in the lineup, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-30/apple-readies-biggest-push-into-health-yet-with-revamped-app-ai-doctor-service-m8vl97k2\"><em>Bloomberg </em>has reported</a> that an M5-powered Pro could be coming as soon as this year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apple does appear to be updating its devices more often than before, sometimes on an iPhone-style annual schedule. Obviously, your iPad doesn’t need to be upgraded that often, and the year-to-year upgrades tend to be small. So our advice still holds: if you need a new one, now’s a good time. If you don’t, there seems to always be an upgrade just around the corner.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, June 30th: </strong>Adjusted prices and availability.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"There are no bad iPads. That’s the best news about Apple’s tablet lineup: 15 years after Steve Jobs first debuted the device, the iPad is the best tablet on the market, and it’s not particularly close. Apple’s App Store is enormous and filled with great apps, Apple’s performance and battery life are consistently excellent, and the iPad is still the company’s most versatile device. That’s one easy answer to your question: yes, if you want a tablet you should buy an iPad. Even last year’s iPad, or heck, last-last year’s iPad is still a solid device. Buying an older but better device — last year’s Pro instead of this year’s Air, for instance — is a tried and true iPad formula.\nBut which of all those good iPads should you buy? That’s never been more complicated. Apple sells six different iPads — the Pro in two sizes, the Air in two sizes, the Mini, and the regular ol’ iPad — all of which come with different specs and accessory options. It’s all too much.\n \n\nThe best iPad value\nThe best long-term iPad\nThe best iPad, period\nThe best iPad Mini\nAn aside on specs and extras\nWhat’s coming next\n\nI’ve tested every iPad currently on the market and have been an iPad user and reviewer since the very first model. (I’m pretty sure I got a job in 2010 because I had a brand-new iPad with me at the interview, but that’s another story.) After using all these tablets and accessories, I think I can help you make the choice.\nThe simplest way to pick an iPad is by process of elimination. First, there’s your budget: you can spend $350 on an iPad, you can spend $2,728 on an iPad, or you can spend just about anything in between. You should also decide whether you need an Apple Pencil and which one has the features you need, because not every iPad supports every model. The same goes for the keyboard attachments. Between price and accessories, your choice might be instantly obvious.\nMore broadly, though, your iPad-buying journey starts with two crucial questions. The first is: what kind of iPad user are you? There are roughly two types. The first and most common iPad user mostly uses it like a larger iPhone: it’s a bigger screen on which to send emails, do the crossword, watch Netflix, and other fairly casual activities. The second type of iPad user, on the other hand, uses it like a touchscreen Mac: it’s for video editing, 3D modeling, creating presentations, crushing spreadsheets, and generally Doing Work of all sorts. You’ll also email and Netflix, of course, but you want your iPad to be a primary computing device. \nI think most people fall into the first category. (Honestly, I also think a lot of people who believe they fall into the second category… mostly don’t.)\nThe second question is more complicated to answer, and it’s what makes the iPad-buying process so tricky right now: how long do you expect to keep your iPad? If you’re looking for a device for the kids to beat up or something that will be your travel companion until you inevitably leave it somewhere, you’re going to end up with a very different device than if you’re shopping for your main computer for the next decade. In general, if you take care of your iPad, I think you can reasonably expect it to last at least five years — so that’s the timeline I have in mind as we go through this guide. \nI used to say that almost everyone should just get the base iPad. Now, I think there are two options worth seriously considering. No matter which one you choose, all the models on this list will receive Apple’s recently announced iPadOS 26 update this fall.\nThe best iPad value\nApple iPad (11th generation)\nApple’s 11th-gen iPad is the successor to the previous 10-gen model.

Now that it comes with at least 128GB of storage, I have few complaints with this device.\nThe 11-inch screen is the right size for most iPad things, the camera is good and is located in the right place, it supports the Apple Pencil — though not the newer Pencil Pro — and even its A16 chip is plenty for most casual iPad uses. All the other iPads have slightly nicer screens, particularly the antireflective coating that helps mitigate glare, but that’s almost certainly not worth the additional price for most buyers.\nHere’s my reservation: the base model iPad is further behind the Air than ever before, and I worry about how that’ll play out over the next few years. If you decide to start using your iPad for more creative tasks, then you might regret not getting the Air’s M3 chip. If, by some miracle, Apple Intelligence becomes awesome in the next few years, you won’t be able to use it. \nIf you only wanted an iPad to last a couple years, for everyday iPad tasks, I’d tell you to buy this one without a second’s hesitation. But there’s a chance this one will feel old and outdated long before the Air does.\nRead our full iPad (11th-gen) review.\nThe best long-term iPad\n11-inch iPad Air M3 (128GB, Wi-Fi)\nThe latest 11-inch iPad Air features Apple’s fast M3 chip with GPU upgrades like dynamic caching for smoother performance in demanding apps.

The new M3 chip is only a tiny upgrade over the M2 — I don’t even notice it in day-to-day use — but I’ll never complain about having newer chips. The biggest upgrade to the Air this year is actually the new Magic Keyboard, which adds a row of function keys and makes the setup a much more credible laptop replacement. (The new keyboard also works with the M2 Air, and if you can find that device on sale somewhere, it’s still a great tablet.)\nThe base iPad to iPad Air upgrade is straightforward enough. You get better accessories, a somewhat better screen, and a noticeably better processor for $250. (You also get the option of a 13-inch device for another $200, but I think an 11-inch iPad is the right size for most people — the 13-inch models start to feel more like laptops than tablets.) If you’re playing Netflix and browsing the web, that $250 won’t get you much, but as soon as you start noodling around in Final Cut or even GarageBand, you’ll notice the difference. There’s a lot of room to grow into the Air, whereas the base iPad may hit its ceiling much sooner.\nThe other thing the Air offers that the base iPad doesn’t is Apple Intelligence. Right now, this is not a problem: there is exactly nothing in Apple Intelligence worth spending $250 on. But if you’re an AI believer, you should know that the base iPad won’t get whatever’s coming.\nRead our full iPad Air M3 review.\nThe best iPad, period\n13-inch iPad Pro M4\nThe newest iPad Pro comes in either an 11- or 13-inch configuration with Apple’s M4 processor.

The Tandem OLED screen is bright and crisp, the tablet is barely thicker than its USB-C port, it’s light, it’s thin, and it’s about as well made as you could expect a tablet to be. The M4 chip is plenty fast even for high-end games and ultra-complex creativity apps. It supports the new, lighter, better Magic Keyboard case and the Pencil Pro. I have plenty of qualms about how powerful an operating system iPadOS is, and the limits it places on just how powerfully you can use an iPad, but the M4 Pro is everything you’d want in a tablet.\nBut oh boy, the price. The Pro starts at $999 for the 11-inch model, and if you want a keyboard, a Pencil, and even a single storage upgrade, you’re quickly looking at a $2,000 purchase. If we’re just talking about a Netflix and email machine, we’re long past the point of diminishing returns. But if you don’t care, and you just want the best thing money can buy? Here it is.

I very much am: I’ve used a Mini for years as my device for reading in bed, watching movies on airplanes, and playing games on the go. The latest Mini is a bit of a disappointment, with a slightly underpowered processor and an old design that could have used smaller bezels and a relocated camera. But it’s still the iPad Mini, and it’s still good enough for most tablet things. If you want an iPad Mini, this is it.\nRead our full iPad Mini review.\nAn aside on specs and extras\nOnce you’ve picked an iPad model, you still have a bunch of decisions to make. And many of them are about specs and features that will cost you hundreds of dollars. Here are my recommendations for some of the things you’ll encounter:\nCellular coverage: You probably don’t need this. Unless you live in a really remote place, Wi-Fi is available in most places. That said, I’ve found that I use cell-equipped iPads far more often when I can just pull them out and know they’re connected — there’s something about busting it out in the park or on the subway that just feels great. Plus, it’s a really useful hotspot for other devices. This isn’t the first place I’d spend my money, though.\nStorage: This is the first place I’d spend my money. All the iPads now come with at least 128GB of storage, which is a big upgrade — 64GB was just never enough. Even now, though, I recommend springing for 256GB if you can afford it; you’d be surprised at how quickly your photos, videos, and Netflix downloads add up.\nEngraving: Don’t do this. It screws up returns and makes selling or giving it away harder. Just don’t do it.\nApple Pencil: As much as I’d love for this to be an all-purpose accessory, it’s really not. Buy it (either the USB-C or the Pro) if you plan to handwrite or draw a lot. Otherwise, skip it.\nMagic Keyboard: This is the first accessory I’d recommend to most people — many people type a lot on their iPads, and it’s also a handy stand and dock for the tablet. You can find cheaper keyboard docks than Apple’s, but I haven’t found one I like better. It’s expensive no matter which model you buy, though.\nMy gadget shopping advice is always to buy the best thing you can afford and hold it for as long as possible, and that’s more doable with an iPad than almost any other device category. If you have the extra $100 to spend on storage, do it. If you want to upgrade because you think AI will get more powerful in the next few years, go for it! Just make sure you know which kind of iPad user you really are, and get the best one you’ll actually make use of. Hopefully for a long time to come.\nWhat’s coming next\nFor the first time in a while, the iPad lineup feels fairly up to date. The Air, Mini, and base model have all been updated in the last several months. The Pro is actually the oldest device in the lineup, and Bloomberg has reported that an M5-powered Pro could be coming as soon as this year. \nApple does appear to be updating its devices more often than before, sometimes on an iPhone-style annual schedule. Obviously, your iPad doesn’t need to be upgraded that often, and the year-to-year upgrades tend to be small. So our advice still holds: if you need a new one, now’s a good time. If you don’t, there seems to always be an upgrade just around the corner.\nUpdate, June 30th: Adjusted prices and availability.","summary":"There are no bad iPads.

They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. And while they’re far less fragile than when they first debuted, foldables are still susceptible to the kind of damage a regular smartphone can shrug off. You <em>really</em> don’t want any dust getting in that hinge. But if you’re an adventurous sort of gadget lover, then a folding phone is a rewarding investment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone <em>plus a tablet</em>, and a flip-style foldable is a phone <em>plus a smartwatch.</em> The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even <em>more </em>phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#best-book-style-foldable\">Best book-style foldable</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-flip-style-foldable\">Best flip-style foldable</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-most-fun-foldable\">The most fun foldable</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-foldable-for-multitaskers\">The best foldable for multitaskers</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-i-can-t-believe-it-s-this-thin-foldable\">The best “I can’t believe it’s this thin” foldable</a></li><li><a href=\"#other-foldables-to-consider\">Other foldables to consider</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-book-style-foldable\">Best book-style foldable</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a 6.3-inch outer screen and an 8-inch inner screen once it’s unfolded — both of which are larger than the original Pixel Fold.

Where the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6’s long and narrow outer screen suffers from Remote Control Syndrome, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels like an ideal form factor. The outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular phone, and the whole package is light enough that you can sometimes forget you’re holding a phone that folds in half.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are some shortcomings. Like other folding phones, the 9 Pro Fold has a slightly downgraded camera system compared to its slab-style siblings. You still get a good 48-megapixel main and a 5x optical zoom, but don’t expect to be able to push it too hard in dim lighting. And like other foldables, there’s no formal dust resistance, just IPX8 resistance to full water immersion. Google’s multitasking software isn’t as flexible as Samsung’s either, and you can fit two apps side-by-side on the screen rather than the Z Fold 6’s anything-goes approach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not perfect, but no folding phone is. The hardware matters a lot on a device like this, and Google got the hardware <em>very</em> right with the 9 Pro Fold.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"read-our-full-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24237586/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-screen-camera-battery\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"17551\">Read our full Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-flip-style-foldable\">Best flip-style foldable</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</h3>\n<div class=\"product-description\">The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers slight design and performance upgrades compared to the previous generation.

But it’s more reliable, is scheduled to get seven years of software updates, and Samsung’s extended warranty offers good coverage for that extra peace of mind. Not the most titillating stuff, but it matters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As you might guess from the name, the Flip 6 is far from Samsung’s first flip-phone rodeo. It comes with some thoughtful updates, like a true always-on display for the cover screen and a tweaked UI for adding widgets more easily. The cameras are good, though far from the <em>best</em> you can get for $1,100, and the battery goes all day. Its IP48 rating means there’s <em>some</em> protection from small particles, but dust is still a concern. Power users will need to download Good Lock to get the most out of the cover screen, but it’s perfectly capable out of the box for someone less adventurous. A bit boring? Yes, but that’s okay.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"read-our-full-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211507/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review-screen-battery-camera\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"20056\">Read our full Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-most-fun-foldable\">The most fun foldable</h2>\n<div class=\"product-block\"><h3>Motorola Razr Ultra (2025)</h3>\n<figure class=\"product-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/257754_Motorola_Razr_Ultra_AJohnson_0004.jpg?w=300\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"Motorola Razr Ultra on a green background showing wooden back panel\" /></figure>\n<div class=\"product-scores\"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class=\"product-pros-cons\"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>One of the best-looking phones you can buy</li><li>Great battery life</li><li>Outer screen is useful in unexpected ways</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>AI button is wasted real estate </li><li>Long-term durability is still a question mark</li><li>Camera processing is occasionally weird</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Unlocked-Camera-Pantone-Mountain/dp/B0F2GWB81K\"> $1299 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-512gb-unlocked-pantone-scarab/6625234.p?skuId=6625234\"> <strike>$1299</strike> $1169.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/phones/razr/razr-ultra/pmipmhn40ms\"> $1299 at <strong>Motorola</strong></a></li></ul></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Screen:</strong> 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / <strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / <strong>Battery:</strong> 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP48</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus.

They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. And while they’re far less fragile than when they first debuted, foldables are still susceptible to the kind of damage a regular smartphone can shrug off. You really don’t want any dust getting in that hinge. But if you’re an adventurous sort of gadget lover, then a folding phone is a rewarding investment. \nThere are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.\nSo while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.\nIf I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest book-style foldable\nBest flip-style foldable\nThe most fun foldable\nThe best foldable for multitaskers\nThe best “I can’t believe it’s this thin” foldable\nOther foldables to consider\nWhat’s coming next\n\nBest book-style foldable\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a 6.3-inch outer screen and an 8-inch inner screen once it’s unfolded — both of which are larger than the original Pixel Fold. The new foldable also lays flat when opened, sports IPX8 weather resistance, and offers a thinner design than the last-gen model.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nExcellent outer screen format\nInner screen is lovely to use\nSeven years of OS updates\n\nExpensive\nMain camera isn’t as good as slab phones\nLong-term durability?\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1799 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1799 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1799 at Google (256GB)\n\nScreen: 8-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.3-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,650mAh / Charging: 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather resistance: IPX8\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold is only Google’s second folding phone, but it’s more refined than you might expect from a sophomore effort. Where the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6’s long and narrow outer screen suffers from Remote Control Syndrome, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels like an ideal form factor. The outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular phone, and the whole package is light enough that you can sometimes forget you’re holding a phone that folds in half. \nThere are some shortcomings. Like other folding phones, the 9 Pro Fold has a slightly downgraded camera system compared to its slab-style siblings. You still get a good 48-megapixel main and a 5x optical zoom, but don’t expect to be able to push it too hard in dim lighting. And like other foldables, there’s no formal dust resistance, just IPX8 resistance to full water immersion. Google’s multitasking software isn’t as flexible as Samsung’s either, and you can fit two apps side-by-side on the screen rather than the Z Fold 6’s anything-goes approach. \nIt’s not perfect, but no folding phone is. The hardware matters a lot on a device like this, and Google got the hardware very right with the 9 Pro Fold.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review.\nBest flip-style foldable\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers slight design and performance upgrades compared to the previous generation. The AI-ready Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 now comes with 12GB of RAM and a vapor chamber for cooling. It also has a new 50-megapixel camera sensor that enables 2x optical zoom.\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAll-day battery\nUseful cover screen\nSeven years of software updates\n\nCover screen resolution could be better\nHard to run apps on the outer screen\nLong-term durability still uncertain\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1099.99 $949.99 at Amazon (256GB)\n $1099.99 $949.99 at Best Buy (256GB)\n $1099.99 at Samsung (512GB)\n\nScreen: 6.7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 3.4-inch, 720p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP48\nThe Flip 6 lacks some of the imaginative UI touches you can get on Motorola’s Razer Ultra, and the file folder-shaped outer screen feels more cramped than Motorola’s approach to fill the space — minus camera lenses, of course. But it’s more reliable, is scheduled to get seven years of software updates, and Samsung’s extended warranty offers good coverage for that extra peace of mind. Not the most titillating stuff, but it matters.\nAs you might guess from the name, the Flip 6 is far from Samsung’s first flip-phone rodeo. It comes with some thoughtful updates, like a true always-on display for the cover screen and a tweaked UI for adding widgets more easily. The cameras are good, though far from the best you can get for $1,100, and the battery goes all day. Its IP48 rating means there’s some protection from small particles, but dust is still a concern. Power users will need to download Good Lock to get the most out of the cover screen, but it’s perfectly capable out of the box for someone less adventurous. A bit boring? Yes, but that’s okay.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review.\nThe most fun foldable\nMotorola Razr Ultra (2025)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nOne of the best-looking phones you can buy\nGreat battery life\nOuter screen is useful in unexpected ways\n\nAI button is wasted real estate \nLong-term durability is still a question mark\nCamera processing is occasionally weird\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1299 at Amazon\n $1299 $1169.99 at Best Buy\n $1299 at Motorola\n\nScreen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48\nThe Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.\nBeyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing.
