Our own Allison Johnson just published <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/709990/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review\">her full review</a> ahead of the phone’s launch on July 25th, and while there’s certainly no denying it’s a spendy device, know that various carriers and retailers are offering a host of preorder incentives, many of which will expire at launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although the Z Fold 7 isn’t miles ahead of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24204714/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-screen-battery-camera\">last-gen Z Fold 6</a> in terms of performance, it measures just 8.9mm thick when folded, making it look and feel like something of a next-gen foldable. The outer screen has also increased in size from 6.3 inches to 6.5 inches, which, when taken into account alongside its thickness, makes the Z Fold 7 feel more akin to a normal phone when folded. Alas, if only it had a “normal phone” price tag instead of an exuberant starting price of $1,999.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That being said, it’s still possible to save on a preorder purchase, or at the very least receive some credit you can then spend on accessories like the Galaxy Watch 8.

But that’s not how trade-in credit works if you’re buying directly through carriers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Carriers across the board are currently offering a $1,100 trade-in credit toward the Z Fold 7, which will be paid back in the form of monthly installments. <strong><a href=\"https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7.html\">AT&amp;T</a></strong> will provide $1,100 in credits over 36 months to customers on postpaid unlimited plans who purchase the new phone with an installment plan.
